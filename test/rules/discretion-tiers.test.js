// there is no such rule and no scan — the residual stated at § "The residual, stated and fixtured
// below" and its passing fixtures are exactly that gap, and an earlier version of this paragraph
// claimed the opposite.
//

// the point: a control that re-implements a subset of the check reports on itself, not on the
// rule, and can pass while the real pin rejects the very text it calls acceptable.

// A span *containing* a destructive command, not one that starts with it: `env git push -f` and

//

// `Branches:` fail an Anchor-named test, although `rules/discretion.md` gives this file a Default
// baseline and elevates only destructive operations, protected branches, attribution and secrets.
// Replacing that with an allowlist of line *prefixes* outside the block was worse in both
// directions at once: a waiver reusing the allowed `PR workflow:` prefix passed, while adding a
// blank line failed. Prefix identity is not a semantic boundary, and inventing one was the error.
//
// **Outside the markers there is now no scan at all, and that is the fix rather than a gap.**
// Three successive revisions tried to police the rest of the file — first an execution-verb
// vocabulary rule, then a destructive-command scan — and every one of them failed in BOTH
// directions on evidence:

//   "PR documentation: the report prints the literal example `git push`; it does not execute it."
//        → honest Default-tier documentation, reported as a grant
//
// The second is disqualifying on its own: `rules/discretion.md` gives this file a **Default**
// baseline, so ordinary edits must be free, and a test named after an Anchor contract that blocks
// them gets weakened by the next maintainer — taking the pins with it.
//
// **What this suite therefore claims, exactly.** Three pinned surfaces, each a line-exact snapshot

//
//   1. the marked authorization block — the prohibition, its three workflow grants and the
//      user-authorized-execution grant (2026-09-05)
//   2. the Push safety paragraph — which credential authorizes a push (round 5 added it)
//   3. the Prohibited / Protected-branches paragraph (round 16 added it)
//
// All three are closed by construction — any widening, in any spelling, changes bytes. Everything
// else in this file is Default-tier prose that this suite does not judge.
//
// **The scoping rule, since three revisions have missed it in one direction or the other:** pin the
// lines the tier registry names — not the Default-tier prose around them, and not fewer. A pin that
// reaches past its Anchor content makes ordinary edits fail an Anchor-named test (round 14 swallowed
// `Claude allowed:`; round 17 swallowed this test's own rationale); a pin that stops short leaves an
// Anchor surface widenable with a green suite (round 16, the protected-branch line). Both are tier
// errors and only line-exact scoping avoids both.
//
// **The residual, stated and fixtured below.** A grant written outside all three pinned surfaces is
// not detected here. What makes it reviewable is structural rather than lexical: the markers declare
// where authorization lives, so a sentence about authorization sitting outside them is visible to
// document review as misplaced. Claiming to catch it mechanically is what four rounds disproved.
const CANONICAL_AUTHORIZATION_BLOCK = [
  // **The marker line carries the token and nothing else, and rounds 17–18 are why.** It used to

  // and two Anchor-named tests failed on an edit that moved no command, no credential and no

The hook prompts on two classes, and they ask different questions: (i) a push whose ref set includes a **protected branch**, with `ALLOW_PUSH_PROTECTED` unset — *may this branch be pushed to at all*; and (ii) a push that **rewrites a ref other people may already hold**, with `ALLOW_FORCE_UNSHARED` unset — and what counts as a rewrite is decided **per ref class**, so the branch rule stated next is not the whole class: for a **branch** it is a non-fast-forward, read **fail-closed**, so ancestry *failing to answer* counts exactly as ancestry answering no — the gate negates `merge-base --is-ancestor` with `!`, which collapses its exit 1 — not an ancestor — and every error above it (a corrupt or unreadable graph) into the same branch, making the class *not provably a fast-forward* rather than *provably a rewrite*; for an **existing tag** the ancestry answer never *decides* — the gate ORs `is_tag_ref` over the negated ancestry test, so `merge-base` still runs on a tag and is simply overridden, and every update to one is in the class whichever way it answered, forward moves included (why, below). Over the rewritten refs class (i) does not already cover, the question is *is anybody else working on them*. For either class, with the hook installed: Primary gate = `pre-push-gate.sh` (git hook, `/dev/tty` confirmation), and AskUserQuestion in `/push-ci` is advisory only (session caching may auto-approve). For every push in neither class, and whenever the hook is not installed: AskUserQuestion in `/push-ci` **is** the authorization — there is no stronger mechanism to defer to, and treating an absent gate as a reason to push unasked would turn opting out of a confirmation into opting out of approval. Because the hook is opt-in, that second case is where class (ii) would otherwise have no attestation at all, so `/push-ci`, `/epic-merge` and `/gh-stack` must put the unshared question to the user **themselves, by name and before the force approval**, and refuse the push when the answer is not the attestation — approval of a force form is not evidence about who else holds the branch. Non-fast-forward is an orthogonal earlier refusal, not a class of its own: without `ALLOW_FORCE_WITH_LEASE=1` the push is refused before any credential is selected, but **which mechanism refuses depends on the push form** — the hook's own `exit 1` where git hands it the ref (the force-form push), and git itself, client-side, **before the hook runs** where it does not. That second case is the flagless one: git withholds a ref it has already rejected, so the hook is invoked with an empty ref list, finds no branch, detects no divergence and exits 0 having refused nothing — the `[rejected] … (non-fast-forward)` the operator sees is git's, not the gate's. Either way an authorization of nothing, since the push does not happen; and with the variable set it falls through to the same protected-branch decision, so a *protected* non-fast-forward push does reach `/dev/tty`. **A second, orthogonal gate stands beside that one** (2026-08-21, option A — `docs/features/push-gate-optin/requests/2026-08-20-push-ci-force-with-lease-r5.md`): a push that rewrites history must additionally carry an attestation that the rewritten refs are not shared — either `ALLOW_FORCE_UNSHARED=1`, or the operator typing `yes` at the hook's `/dev/tty` prompt naming them. What is measured is the **topology, not the declared flag** — and topology is read per ref class, because ancestry is the *branch* rule: for a branch the gate asks about the refs whose remote tip is not an ancestor of what replaces it, so a `--force-with-lease` that turns out to be an ordinary fast-forward rewrites nothing and is not asked about; for a **tag** that test is the wrong question, since git requires force semantics — `--force`, a satisfied `--force-with-lease`, or a leading `+` in the refspec — for any update to an existing `refs/tags/*` ref, forward moves included — a tag names one commit rather than a line of history — so every update to an existing tag is asked about while a tag *creation*, having no history to overwrite, is not. A ref listed with an unchanged OID moves nothing and is likewise not asked about. A **deletion** is the third exclusion, and it is the one an \"every update to an existing tag\" reading loses: the gate's rewrite test requires a non-null OID on **both** sides, so removing an existing ref — `git push origin :refs/tags/v1` — never reaches the unshared attestation, and a deletion outside the protected set reaches no prompt at all; deleting a **protected branch** still reaches the protected prompt, because the gate collects every destination branch for that check before its rewrite test runs. The boundary this draws is narrow and deliberate: the class is about *overwriting* a line of history, not about *removing* a ref. Whether a deletion of something other people hold deserves a prompt of its own was put to the maintainer on 2026-08-22 and deliberately answered *no change*: the class stays about overwriting, and widening it would be its own request, its own attestation and its own refusal path. A rewrite bundled with ordinary creations is asked about for the rewritten refs alone. Non-branch refs keep their full name in the prompt, since a forced tag update is a rewrite of something other people hold. This is what closes the gap between \"shared\" and \"protected\": git cannot decide sharedness, because no ref line, ancestry test or lease reports who else holds the branch, so the class is defined by **attestation, not inference**, and the attestation is the operator's. Three properties are part of the contract: `ALLOW_FORCE_UNSHARED` is developer-set only — `/push-ci`, `/epic-merge` and `/gh-stack` must never set it **and must clear it on every push they execute**, exactly as with `ALLOW_PUSH_PROTECTED`, because a value exported earlier in the shell answers the hook's question without anybody being asked now; `ALLOW_PUSH_PROTECTED` does not skip it, since the two answer different questions; and a rewritten ref is excluded from this prompt **only while the protected prompt will actually ask about it** — `ALLOW_PUSH_PROTECTED=1` silences that prompt, so under it the ref returns to this one. Asking twice about one push is noise rather than depth; asking zero times is the hole an unconditional exclusion left, and it force-pushed `main` past both gates in silence. Never assume which state applies — but never let the hook check decide it either. `/push-ci` Phase 0 reports whether an executable hook *references* the gate (`PUSH_GATE=referenced`, never `installed`), and reference is not invocation: a script that merely names the gate in a live command satisfies the same test. The probe therefore informs how the push plan **describes** the credential; it never **selects** one. The demotion of AskUserQuestion to advisory is earned by the operator seeing the `/dev/tty` prompt, never by the check predicting it — if the approval is given and no prompt appears, that in-session approval was the only approval, whatever the probe reported. This is safe in exactly one direction, and only because nothing is ever skipped on the probe's word.";

// The efficacy contract lives in a section of its own, `## Efficacy Boundary`, and that whole
// section is pinned — **not byte-for-byte**, and also not merely "the non-blank lines". Each
// blank-line run is collapsed to ONE blank and trailing blanks are dropped (see the validator
// below), so run *length* is free while the *presence and position* of every run is pinned along
// with every non-blank line. Measured: doubling a blank line passes; removing one so two paragraphs
// join fails; inserting one that splits a paragraph fails. Both looser phrasings were carried here
// across earlier rounds — "byte-for-byte" over-claimed, "every non-blank line, in order"
// under-claimed — which is why this now describes the measurement rather than the intent.
//
// What the section holds is also two things, not one: Anchor #4 credential selection **and** the
// review obligation that survives that authorization (Registers #5/#6, the closing sentence of the
// section). Describing it as the contract "and nothing else" reads as though that closing sentence
// were outside the intended boundary, which would send the next maintainer to split it back out.
//
// Three rounds each measured why a narrower or wider unit was wrong, and the progression is the
// record worth keeping — every step was executed against the real suite, not reasoned about:
//
//   round 30 — a phrase blacklist. Wrong in BOTH directions: a synonymous unconditional sentence
//     ("`pre-push-gate.sh` remains the final authority; AskUserQuestion merely advises") passed it,
//     while a lawful conditional rewording containing the blacklisted words was rejected. English
//     has an unbounded space of equivalent spellings; no phrase list closes it.
//   round 31 — a byte pin over the blank-line-delimited paragraph. Closed every widening inside
//     the paragraph and none outside it: the same sentence, as its own paragraph two lines further
//     down and still inside the section, left the canonical bytes untouched, kept exactly one line
//     beginning `Efficacy boundary:`, and passed 24/24.
//   round 32 — a byte pin over the whole `## Proposal Channel (efficacy boundary)` section, which
//     closed that hole and opened a tier error instead: the section also held the trigger and
//     uncertainty paragraphs, which are Default-tier prose. Changing "is the wrong reading" to
//     "remains the wrong reading" — semantics untouched, authorization untouched — failed an
//     Anchor-named test. That is the failure this file's own scoping rule (see the header comment
//     above `CANONICAL_AUTHORIZATION_BLOCK`) warns about: a pin reaching past its Anchor content
//     gets weakened by the next maintainer, and takes the real closure with it.
//
// So the rule file was restructured rather than the pin re-tuned: `## Proposal Channel` keeps the
// triggers and the uncertainty exclusion and is **not** pinned; `## Efficacy Boundary` holds the
// Anchor-tier material — credential selection plus the review obligation that outlives it — and is
// pinned whole. The section boundary and the contract boundary are now the same line, which is the
// only arrangement in which "pin the section" is neither too little nor too much.
//
// Blank-line runs are collapsed to one and trailing blanks dropped before comparison. That makes
// run *length* free — the whitespace housekeeping worth being free — while leaving each run's
// presence and position pinned, and it lets no non-blank text through either way.
//
// **The residual, stated rather than implied**, because round 31's finding was exactly a claim of
// closure defeated by a location outside the pinned surface: a contradictory statement placed in a
// DIFFERENT section of this file is not seen here. Round 32 searched for one and found none — the
// hook-versus-AskUserQuestion efficacy rule is written in this section and nowhere else; Register
// #4 enumerates the permitted workflows but does not restate it. If it is ever restated elsewhere,
// this pin stops being sufficient and the restatement is the thing to remove.
const CANONICAL_EFFICACY_SECTION = "## Efficacy Boundary\n\n⚠️ The whole of this section is pinned by `test/rules/discretion-tiers.test.js` — any sentence added,\nremoved or reworded anywhere in it fails that test by design. What it holds is Anchor Register #4\nmaterial: which credential authorizes a push, and the review obligation that survives that\nauthorization. § Proposal Channel above is deliberately left outside the pin, so ordinary\nDefault-tier edits there stay free.\n\nEfficacy boundary: an AskUserQuestion approval can be auto-approved by session caching (`git-workflow.md` § Push safety records this), so it is **never the sole credential for a safety approval outside the workflow that defines it**: it cannot authorize an action beyond the enumerated workflow list, and it cannot bypass a stronger mechanism an anchor names **where that mechanism is actually in place** (for push that mechanism is `pre-push-gate.sh` over `/dev/tty`, and only for the pushes it actually prompts on — the `/push-ci` clause below says which those are). **Inside** an enumerated workflow **that names no stronger mechanism**, the per-use AskUserQuestion approval that workflow's skill defines remains required and sufficient — `/smart-commit --execute` operates on exactly that contract, paired with the runtime validations its skill specifies; the caching weakness is why those pairings exist, not a revocation of the workflows. `/epic-merge` sat here until 2026-08-21 and now sits in both places at once, which is the ordinary shape of this clause rather than an exception to it: its pushes rewrite history, so where the hook is installed they meet the same terminal attestation `/push-ci`'s do and its AskUserQuestion is advisory for them; where it is not, that AskUserQuestion is the whole credential. `/push-ci`, `/epic-merge` and `/gh-stack` are the ones that name a stronger mechanism — **but only where that mechanism exists**: the `pre-push` hook is opt-in (`git-workflow.md` § Push safety), so with the hook installed **and only for the pushes it actually prompts on** — two classes since 2026-08-21: a protected branch with `ALLOW_PUSH_PROTECTED` unset, and a push that rewrites history with `ALLOW_FORCE_UNSHARED` unset, over the rewritten refs the first class does not already cover — read fail-closed, so an ancestry test that errors rather than answering lands in this class exactly as one that answers no — its AskUserQuestion stays required but advisory, and `pre-push-gate.sh` is the terminal credential; where the hook is **not** installed — or where it is installed and **exits 0** without prompting, as it does for every push in neither class — there is no stronger mechanism to bypass, and the workflow's per-use AskUserQuestion is required and sufficient on the same contract as the workflows above. That second half is not a lighter obligation: because the hook is opt-in, a history-rewriting push in an un-hooked project reaches no terminal at all, so `git-workflow.md` § Push safety obliges all three workflows to put the unshared question to the user themselves and refuse without the attestation. An absent gate moves the question, never deletes it. A **refused** push is a third outcome outside that disjunction, never a case inside it: a non-fast-forward push with `ALLOW_FORCE_WITH_LEASE` unset is refused before any credential is selected — by the hook's own `exit 1` where git hands it the ref, and by git itself, before the hook runs, where it does not — so the push does not happen and nothing authorized anything (`git-workflow.md` § Push safety calls it \"an authorization of nothing\" and records which refusal belongs to which push form); set the variable and it falls through to the protected decision, so a *protected* non-fast-forward push still reaches `/dev/tty`. Reading that refusal as a case where AskUserQuestion \"sufficed\" would credit an approval for an operation that never ran. The clause turns on whether the named mechanism is present, never on whether a rule once named it — a credential that is not installed cannot be the one that authorizes, and reading its absence as \"no approval needed\" would invert this whole boundary.\n\nAuthorization is never a reason to skip review: Register #5 and #6 remain Anchor under every assignment in this file.";

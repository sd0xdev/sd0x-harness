// Routing tests for the on-demand contracts (rules-residency, tech spec § 6).
//
// The residency split trades one failure mode for another. Resident prose cannot be forgotten by a
// dispatcher, only diluted; an on-demand contract can be *unreachable* — pointed at by nothing, or
// pointed at through a path or a `§` heading that no longer exists. Both directions fail silently:
// the session simply proceeds without the procedure and nothing says so. So both are asserted here.
//
//   forward  — every FULLY-QUALIFIED `rules/*.md` or `skills/*/references/*.md` citation resolves
//              to a real file AND a real heading in it. Catches the move that repointed nothing.
//
// What it does NOT cover, stated because a test name is read as a guarantee: bare-basename
// citations (`(auto-loop.md § Tiers)`), `skills/*/SKILL.md § …` targets, and the markdown-link
// form `[`x.md`](x.md) (§ H)` the README rows use. Counting bare basenames is itself
// method-dependent — 77, 41 or 36 over this scan set depending on whether a backtick or a single
// space is required — so the honest statement is the shape, not a total: roughly an eighth of the
// `§` occurrences here are validated. Widening to bare basenames needs a unique-basename index to
// resolve against, a larger change than this one; until then the boundary is documented, not
// implied.
//   backward — every registered contract is reachable from its declared activation source. Catches
//              the contract that exists but that no rule or skill will ever cause to be loaded.

// `rules/SKILL.md` and the guard reports a file that was never cited. `agents/` is a citation

// So compare on the heading's leading words: a citation matches when it BEGINS with a real
// heading, at a word boundary. The known cost: a short heading (`Records`) also matches a longer
// citation that merely begins with it — deliberate, since the alternative flags every real
// citation, and a guard that cries wolf gets deleted.
//
// The reverse direction — accepting a citation that is a *prefix* of a heading — was removed: it

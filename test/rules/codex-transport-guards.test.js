// Two design rules learned the hard way, both from review findings on this very file:
//
// 1. **Each guard is ONE predicate function, and its self-test calls that same function.** An
//    earlier version re-implemented the filter inline in each self-test, so a self-test could pass
//    while the production assertion missed the same input (`@rules/testing.md` § Guards: test and
//    controls invoke the same implementation).
// 2. **A predicate must cover the SHAPE, not one spelling of it.** The first version matched
//    `--protocol 1 <subcommand>` adjacently and `codex exec` followed by a flag, so
//    `start --protocol 1`, `codex exec - < prompt.md`, `codex exec "review this"` and
//    `--class "$CLASS"` all sailed through while the adapter accepted them. The synthetic
//    self-tests planted only the spellings already recognised, which is how a guard passes and
//    protects nothing.

// Two review rounds of shape-matching produced two rounds of evasions — `start --protocol 1`,
// `codex exec - < prompt.md`, `codex exec "prompt"`, then `cat p.md | codex exec`,
// `codex exec summarize`, `ACTION=start; node $ADAPTER --protocol 1 $ACTION`. Every fix invited
// the next spelling, because "is this line operational?" is an open-ended question about text.
//
// The invariant is not open-ended: the transport is stated in ONE file. So the predicate is
// membership, not shape — outside the authority (and a shrinking allowlist of files later tickets
// own), a surface may not contain a transport token AT ALL. A skill that needs to talk about
// dispatching cites `codex-transport.md`; it never spells the mechanism. No spelling evades a
// token scan, and there is nothing left to add a case for.
// TOKEN ORDER, not option grammar. Three review rounds were spent enumerating what may sit between
// the binary and its subcommand — adjacency, then global options, then quoted values, redirections,
// `--config 'model = "gpt 5"'` — and each enumeration invited the next form. The CLI's own grammar
// is not the invariant; the invariant is that this line names the binary and then its command.
// So: `codex` appears, and LATER ON THE SAME LOGICAL LINE the token `exec` or `e` appears. Nothing
// in between is modelled, so nothing in between can evade it.

  // Per-file `doesNotMatch` inversions were tried first and each had its own hole: one required a
  // space (`sandbox:'read-only'` slipped through), one required single quotes, and several never
  // checked `approval-policy` at all — a reviewer drove in-memory mutations past all five. One
  // shared assertion over the whole converted set, keyed on the FIELD rather than on any spelling
  // of its value, is what closes that: quoting and whitespace stop mattering.
  // Third formulation. The first demanded a specific quoting of the VALUE and missed
  // `sandbox:'read-only'`; the second demanded a colon after the FIELD and missed every Markdown
  // table row (`| Sandbox | read-only |`) — two reviewers found real restatements it reported clean.
  // It also exempted any line containing "pinned", which let a restatement through by labelling
  // itself. So drop syntax entirely: a restatement is the field and one of the transport's pinned
  // VALUES on the same line. Prose that merely names the fields ("the transport pins the sandbox and
  // approval policy") carries no value and is not a restatement; `codex-setup`'s "Detect sandbox:"
  // carries none either.
  // ONE predicate, used by the production scan and by every self-test — this file's own rule, which
  // an earlier version broke by re-implementing the check inside its mutations. The unit is the
  // blank-line-delimited BLOCK with newlines flattened, so multiline Markdown cannot hide a pair.
  // Fourth formulation, and the first one measured rather than guessed. Requiring `never` to be
  // quoted/backticked/colon-led was too narrow — a reviewer drove `| Approval policy | never |`,
  // `approval_policy = never` and `Approval policy is **never**.` straight past it. Counting it bare
  // was too wide: "…approval policy, so no call site chooses them … never a § Resume" is correct
  // prose and was flagged twice.
  //
  // What actually separates them is DISTANCE. Measured over the real cases: every genuine
  // restatement puts the value within 6 characters of the field; every false positive had them 74+
  // apart. A 20-character window sits in the middle of that gap with room on both sides.

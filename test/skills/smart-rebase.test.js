// Regression: `/smart-rebase` granted itself `git rebase` execution on ordinary user approval,
// outside Anchor Register #4's closed workflow list (found in review, 2026-08-16). Register #4's
// exceptions are part of the anchor, so a skill cannot mint a new one by asking. The defect was not
// that the sentence was badly worded; it was that nothing looked.
//
// **What this file used to do, and why it no longer does.** The first answer was a corpus-wide
// scanner: read every skill's prose, classify each sentence as a grant or not, and read every
// shell script for destructive invocations. Four review rounds each defeated it with a spelling it
// had not anticipated, in BOTH directions — and the second direction is what settled it:
//
//   "It is not prohibited for this skill to execute `git rebase --onto` after approval."
//        → a real grant, passed every test (the negation detector saw `prohibited` and suppressed)
//   "The developer must not execute `git rebase` unless the release manager authorizes it."
//        → an honest human-only restriction, reported as an unbounded grant
//   `echo git rebase --onto main base branch`
//        → a script that only PRINTS, reported as an invocation
//
// English and shell both have an unbounded space of equivalent spellings, so no accumulation of
// patterns closes the set; and a control that fires on honest documentation is one the next
// maintainer deletes, taking the true positives with it. The scanner is therefore gone.
//
// What replaces it is two things that are closed by construction rather than by vocabulary:
//
//   1. **Byte pins** on the two sections of THIS skill that carry the authorization statement.
//      Any widening, in any spelling, changes bytes. This is scoped to the file that had the
//      defect — the corpus-wide claim is what could not be honoured, not the per-file one.
//   2. **Executable evidence** for the analysis script: run it against a recording `git` and
//      assert which subcommands it actually invoked. `echo git rebase` invokes nothing, so the
//      false positive cannot occur; a real `git rebase` is recorded whatever the source looks like.
//
// The corpus-wide guarantee is not replaced, and pretending otherwise is what this comment exists
// to prevent: a NEW skill claiming a rebase grant is caught by review against
// `rules/git-workflow.md`'s pinned authorization set (`test/rules/discretion-tiers.test.js`),
// which is where the closed list actually lives.

// ── 2. Executable evidence: what the analysis script actually invokes ─────────
// A lexical scan cannot tell `git rebase --onto ...` inside a JSON string (which the script emits
// as the `rebase_command` field, for the developer to copy) from an invocation. Running it can:
// data is never executed, so it never reaches the recorder.
//
// **What this section proves, and what it does not.** It runs the script under a `git` injected on
// PATH and records every call. That is real evidence about the paths it drives, and it saw through
// two spellings a scanner could not: a runtime-assembled `git "$c$d"`, and a global option hiding
// the subcommand. It is *not* a proof that no destructive execution is possible — three forms reach
// around the shim entirely, and none of them is observable here:
//
//   `/usr/bin/git rebase …`                  — an absolute path never consults PATH
//   `git -c alias.x='!git rebase …' x`       — git executes a shell alias defined on the spot
//   any other binary, wrapper or `sh -c`     — the shim only shims `git`
//
// The middle one reaches the recorder (it *is* PATH-resolved git) but what it runs is the alias
// value, which the shim never executes. So all three are covered by `SCRIPT_DIGEST` below, not by
// anything this harness observes — "what can this shell script execute" is not a decidable
// question, and every round that tried to answer it lexically failed in one direction or the other.
//
// **Which is why the check below is an allow-list, and why it stopped being a classifier.** Three
// rounds were spent teaching a deny-list how git dispatches — global options, then `--help`, then
// case-insensitive aliases, then `--config-env`, then alias values that shadow a built-in — and
// each round found another spelling, in both directions. That set is unbounded because git's
// dispatch is.
//
// The property that closes it is about *this script*, not about git: **it uses no git global
// options**, so `argv[0]` is the subcommand for every call the script is supposed to make and no
// model of git's dispatch is needed. A global option, an alias assignment, `--version`, `--help`, a
// different subcommand: all of them fail to match, none of them has to be recognised.
//
// Writing the list down is itself the mechanism, and twice now it has paid: `fetch` was missing from
// the first draft and every run reported it, and `check-ref-format` was added the same way when the
// script started validating `--target`. A call nobody enumerated is a finding until someone decides
// it belongs.

// **`argv[0]` alone was not enough, and neither was a union of permitted flags.** A subcommand is
// not an operation: `git branch --show-current` reads and `git branch -D main` deletes, with the
// same `argv[0]`. Round 20 added a flag dimension for that, and round 21 broke it in both
// directions at once — which is the signature of a rule that is not shaped like the thing it
// guards:
//
//   `git branch --quiet victim HEAD`  — creates a branch, and every token was independently allowed
//   `git rev-parse --short :/.`       — a legitimate read the colon rule reported
//
// A per-token union cannot separate those, because the danger is not in any token: it is in the
// *combination*. So the check is now a list of **whole argv shapes**, one per call site the script
// actually contains. Each entry is that call site with its literal flags in their literal order;
// `*` is one argument the script interpolates.
//
// This is closed the same way the subcommand list was, one level tighter: the templates *are* the
// call sites, so a call the script does not make cannot match one, whatever its tokens look like.
// `--quiet victim HEAD` matches no shape. `--short :/.` matches `rev-parse --short *` and is
// allowed, because it is a read the script legitimately performs with a caller-supplied `--base`.
//
// **Slot semantics are per call site, not one global wildcard rule** — round 22 broke the global
// version in both directions at once. `ANY_REV` forbids a leading `-`, which is right for a value
// that has already passed validation; applied to *every* slot it also reported
// `check-ref-format --allow-onelevel -evil`, which is the script's own safety check being handed a
// value that is option-shaped by construction. That call is the guard, so its argument slot has to
// accept exactly what the other slots refuse. (The script no longer passes the *bare* stripped
// token — round 23 moved it to `refs/heads/<name>` — but `RAW_INPUT` still has to accept whatever
// `--target` was, and that is unvalidated by definition.)
//
//   `RAW_INPUT` — the value under test. Unvalidated is the point; anything matches
//   `ANY_REV`   — a ref, rev or range that reached this call already validated or built here
//
// The fetch has no slot entry at all: its safety is a relationship between two arguments, which is
// what `FETCH_CALL` below exists to express.

// would pass one slot at a time while writing into a namespace the call did not name.
//
// The character class is `[^:*]`, and round 24 is why it is not tighter. The previous class also

// `rev-parse <full>` agree, which is what the --base cut-point comparison needs.
// **`$1` is not the subcommand, and reading it as one was a hole in this harness.** `git` accepts
// global options before the subcommand, and two of them take a separate value:
// `git -C . rebase --onto main base branch` is a real, destructive invocation whose `$1` is `-C`.
// The old shim fell through to its default success branch and the old classifier reported the
// subcommand as `.`, so a mutation using the standard `-C` form would have run a rebase while the
// suite reported none. Both sides share that rule — skip global options, consuming the value of the
// ones that take one, and take the first remaining bare word. The JS classifier goes two steps
// further (`help`, `alias`, documented at `gitSubcommand`); the shim does not need to, because its
// only use for the answer is picking which canned reply to print, and both of those fall through to
// its default.

// `"$*"` flattens `git commit -m "a b"` into words no reader can put back, and argument boundaries

// one byte further out: a tab is a legal argv byte, so `git -c 'x.y=<TAB>bar' rebase` decoded as
// four fields instead of three and the subcommand resolved to `bar`. NUL is the one byte `execve`
// cannot carry inside an argument, and the `$#` prefix means the reader never has to guess where one
// call ends — it is told, by the process that knows.
// `check-ref-format` is delegated to the real git rather than answered by a canned reply. It is a
// pure function of its argument — no repository, no network — and the script now uses it as the
// gate on `--target`. A shim that fell through to its default `exit 0` would accept every ref

// something else is a failure. `refspecs=$(…); rc=$?` cannot deliver that under `set -e`: an
// assignment whose command substitution fails carries that status itself, so the shell aborts
// before `rc` is ever read and the three carefully separated outcomes collapse into one silent
// exit. Putting the command in an `if` condition is what exempts it — that is the only reason the
// shape is written the way it is, so it is asserted by running it, not by reading it.

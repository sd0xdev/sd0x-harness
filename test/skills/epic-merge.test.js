// ── Protected head branches: the prohibited force-push target ─────────────────
// /epic-merge force-pushes every PR head (Step 5) and the rollback path pushes
// the same ref. A PR head is not inherently unprotected — a PR can be opened
// FROM main — so "only pushes to PR head branches" was never a safety argument
// on its own. git-workflow.md § Prohibited forbids force push to shared branches,
// and the protected set is the decidable part of the shared set (skills/push-ci/SKILL.md
// Phase 0 step 0 states the judgment and its residue). The
// refusal lives in three places: the Phase 0 validation gate, and an exact-match
// guard re-asserted immediately before the Step 5 push and the rollback push.
// The guards are executable text, so they are extracted and run — a reworded or
// inverted case pattern stays green under a text match and fails here. Both
// directions ship together (rules/testing.md § Guards): the heads that must be
// refused, and same-word heads that must still pass.

// **Token ownership cannot be decided by a regex over the raw line.** The separator check below
// asks "is `--` the last argument of *this* `git log`", and a scan that stops at the first `)`
// or `|` answers about the wrong command: `git log --oneline "pkg" "$(printf pkg --)"` has its
// `--` inside a nested substitution, and cutting there made the line look separated when git in
// fact reads both arguments as paths and returns plausible history with exit 0. The same
// regex rejected a legitimate quoted `)` or `|`. Both directions come from one missing property —
// quoting — so this walks the string once, tracking quotes and substitution depth, and treats a
// metacharacter as a terminator only when it is unquoted and at depth 0.

// **A token is not yet a word, and the flag checks compare words.** `shellTokens` keeps quote
// characters so the separator check can see the argument exactly as written, but the shell strips
// them before git ever sees the argument — so `"--force"` and `--force` are the same flag to git
// and two different strings to a `Set.has`. Measured against a real remote: both
// `git push "--force" origin main` and `git push -uf origin main` performed a **forced update
// with exit 0** and destroyed the remote history, while the token-set control returned `[]` for
// each. That is the exact failure class this control exists to catch, evading it twice.
//
// One normalization, therefore, where flags are compared:
//   **Unquote** — remove the quoting, keep the characters, so `--fo"rce"` reads as one word.
// **And the comparison is against git's option parser, not against exact spellings.** A further
// measured evasion of the exact-token form: **abbreviation.** git accepts any *unambiguous* prefix
// of a long option, so `--no-force-i` and `--no-force-w` reach the remote while a `Set.has` on the
// full spelling sees neither. `--force` itself has no abbreviation hole — `--forc` is refused as
// `ambiguous option` because the two lease options share the prefix — but the `--no-` forms are
// unique early. So the option table below is git push's own (from `git push -h`, git 2.55.0) and
// abbreviations are resolved against it.
//
// **Short-flag clusters are refused, not modelled — the model was wrong three rounds running.**
// It began as "split `-uf` into `-u -f`", which reported a bare force on `-of` (`-o` is
// `--push-option`, so `f` is its value); the fix — stop at the first value-taking letter — then
// misplaced git's argument separator, because `-vo` ends in a value-taking letter and therefore
// eats the **next** argument: measured, `git push -vo -- --dry-run . -- refs/heads/main:…`
// selected `.` as the remote and reached receive-pack, proving the first `--` was consumed as the
// `-o` value. A model that has produced a defect on each of its three outings is not worth a
// fourth. A cluster on a push command line is now reported as undecidable — a refusal, which is
// what `-uf` earned anyway, and the direction that cannot be wrong. Neither skill's pushes use
// one; the cost is that a legitimate `-uq` would be rejected until someone spells it `-u -q`.

// `env "$cmd" push`, `if "$cmd" push`, `git "$sub"`, `git $'push'`. Every one of them left the

  //   * a bare `env` is a command word with no slash, so bash resolves an imported
  //     `BASH_FUNC_env%%` function first — and the forged function ignores every `-u`, which was
  //     the whole sanitization. `command env` is no better (functions outrank builtins). bash
  //     refuses to IMPORT a function whose name contains `/`, which is what the absolute path buys.
  //     It buys exactly that and no more — round 64 measured a slashed name being DEFINED rather
  //     than imported (`function /usr/bin/env { …; }` in a sourced `$BASH_ENV` file), and both bash
  //     3.2 and zsh 5.9 then resolved `/usr/bin/env` to the function and ran no child. So the
  //     prefix closes the environment channel; the startup-file channel is closed by Phase 0 step
  //     0a, which refuses on the set-ness of `BASH_ENV`/`ENV` before anything is read.

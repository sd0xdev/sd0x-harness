// ── Structural closure: the whole document is the execution surface ───────────
// Two narrower attempts failed on evidence, and the second failure is what settled the design.
//
//   Attempt 1 — pin Phase 2 only. A reviewer inserted a sibling `### Phase 1.5: Warm the remote`
//   containing a push. No pinned bytes moved; the suite stayed green.
//
//   Attempt 2 — also pin the heading sequence, and forbid `git push` in shell fences outside
//   Phase 2. The reviewer put the instruction in PROSE inside the existing Phase 1 section
//   ("Before asking for approval, execute `git push origin \"$BRANCH\"` to warm the remote") —
//   no new heading, no fence, still green. And adding an ordinary `## Troubleshooting` section
//   turned the suite red for a change that touches nothing.
//
// The lesson is not that the enumeration was wrong again; it is that **there is no structural
// marker separating prose that instructs from prose that describes** in a document whose entire
// purpose is to instruct. A skill file is an instruction surface: every sentence of it can move
// what Claude executes. So the pinned unit is the file.
//
// A digest change is a REVIEW TRIGGER, not a false positive — the distinction that killed the
// scanners. A scanner's remedy is "reword your honest sentence until the pattern stops matching";
// this one's remedy is one command, printed in the failure message, and the reviewer then sees the
// real diff. For a document that authorizes `git push`, "you cannot change this without someone
// looking at the exact bytes" is the contract, and `rules/discretion.md`'s Default baseline for
// `rules/*.md` does not apply here — that table governs the rule files, not `skills/**`.
//
// The section pins below survive because they give a precise message for the common case; the
// digest is what makes the claim complete.

// **A whitelist, because a blacklist of push spellings is the scanner this session deleted twice.**
// The first replacement searched for `/(?<!`)git push/` and called the result "every restated
// push"; it is not. `git  push` (two spaces), `"git" push`, and — inside these untyped fences,
// which a reader copies into a shell — `` `git push --force origin x` ``, where the backticks are
// command substitution rather than a Markdown code span, all execute a push and none of them
// match. Enumerating spellings is the losing side of that game. So the control states what a
// Phase 2 line **must** be instead, and every one of those three fails it for the same reason any
// other spelling does: it is not the assembly reference.
//
// **The whitelist is over complete lines, because a prefix is not a line.** Round 23 measured what
// an anchored-prefix shape still admits: `Phase 2: Phase 2 assembly — $(git push --force origin x)`
// matches `/^Phase 2: Phase 2 assembly — /`, keeps the count at four, and executes the push through
// command substitution — `CALLED:push --force origin x` under a recording `git`. `… non-force;
// git push --force origin x` is accepted the same way. Any shape that constrains only the head of
// the line leaves the tail free, and the tail is where the command goes. So the permitted lines are
// enumerated in full and membership is exact.
//
// **And the selector is the literal token, not a model of what a label looks like.** Two selectors
// have now failed in opposite directions. `startsWith('Phase 2:')` missed an **indented** fifth
// label (round 23): the count and the shape both passed while Bash ran the push. Widening it to
// "after whitespace or a container marker" then failed both ways at once (round 24) — it read
// honest prose containing `see Phase 2: Execute Push above.` as a fifth label, while `[Phase 2:]`
// and `__Phase 2:__` were not recognized at all, because `[` and `_` were not in the character
// class; each carried an executable `$(git push --force origin x)` and left the predicate true.
// Every such class is a guess about markup, and the next spelling is the one nobody listed.
//
// So the rule is lexical and total: **any line in this section containing the literal `Phase 2:`
// must be one of the four permitted lines.** That is checkable rather than modelled, and it has a
// real cost stated plainly — prose in this section may not use that exact token, so a cross
// reference writes "the Phase 2 assembly" or names the heading without its colon. Measured: the
// section contains exactly four such lines today, and they are the four.
//
// What remains outside the claim is a label spelled some *other* way (`Phase2:`, `Phase  2:`).
// That is the byte pin's job, and the claim above no longer overstates itself into covering it.

  // A branch may legally be named like an option: `git check-ref-format refs/heads/--all` exits 0.
  // Quoting cannot help — the shell consumes the quotes and git's own parser reads what is left.
  // Measured against real git: `git push origin "--all"` answers "Everything up-to-date" (the flag
  // was taken and every branch pushed), while `git push origin -- "--all"` answers "src refspec
  // --all does not match any" — the name arrived as a refspec. The plan the operator approved
  // named ONE branch, so the flag reading pushes refs no approval covered.
  // **And `--` ends option parsing, not refspec parsing** — the round-19 case, and the reason the
  // operand is a full `src:dst` refspec rather than a bare name. `+` leads a force refspec and
  // `git check-ref-format refs/heads/+main` exits 0, so `+main` is a legal branch the protected
  // guard reads as unprotected. Measured with a local `main` rewound behind the remote,
  // `git push origin -- "+main"` — no force flag on the line — reported
  // `+ affcbe7...ad7e970 main -> main (forced update)` and exit 0. It was also the wrong branch:

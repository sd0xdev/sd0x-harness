// measured 2026-08-24 with the marker-carrying probe below, bash 3.2.57 prints `1|2|origin` —
// the startup file RAN (its exported marker survived) and only its forged arguments were papered
// over — while bash 5.3.15 — and every Linux CI runner — prints `1|3|forged1`, the `set --`
// surviving into the script too. The prediction this pin shipped with ("a future bash that
// changed the ordering would make this the first thing to go red") fired on the first CI run
// that executed it under a modern bash. So the pin no longer rests on ordering: what protects
// the hook is its own shebang, `#!/usr/bin/env -S bash -p` — under `-p` the $BASH_ENV file is
// not processed at all (measured `unset|2|origin` on 3.2.57 and 5.3.15 alike), which is the

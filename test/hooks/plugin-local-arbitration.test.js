// Issue #9 — the plugin-defers-to-local arbitration block fired ZERO times, not twice.
//
// The block's three original conditions (CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR set, no dev-mode hooks.json, a local
// copy of `basename "$0"` is executable) are ALL satisfied by the local copy itself, because
// `basename "$0"` identifies WHICH HOOK this is and never WHICH COPY. So the local copy deferred
// to itself, the plugin copy deferred to the local one, and the hook never ran at all — the exact
// inverse of the double-fire the block exists to prevent, and silent.
//
// At the time (pre-lightweighting) that made every downstream guarantee fail open — the then
// fail-closed sidecar was never written by a hook that did not execute, and strict mode did not
// help because stop-guard deferred too. The enforcement layer has since retired, but the defect
// class survives it: a reminder hook that defers to itself is a silent zero-fire all the same.
//
// `pre-edit-guard.sh` is the behavioural probe throughout: it has the cleanest observable of the
// seven — a blocked `.env` edit exits 2 and prints, a deferral exits 0 in silence — so "did the
// hook run" is read off the exit code rather than inferred from a state file.

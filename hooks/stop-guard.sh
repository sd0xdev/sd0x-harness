# === Plugin-defers-to-local arbitration ===
# When running as a plugin hook, detect if identical local hook is installed
# and registered in project settings — if so, exit 0 to avoid double-fire.
# Dev-mode bypass: hooks/hooks.json at project root = plugin source repo (skip arbitration).
_SELF_NAME="$(basename "$0")"
# Identity, not filename: `basename "$0"` says WHICH hook this is, never WHICH COPY. Without the
# comparison below the local copy satisfies every condition and defers to ITSELF — both copies
# exit 0 and the hook never runs at all (zero-fire, the opposite of the double-fire this block
# exists to prevent; issue #9). An unresolvable side leaves the guard false and does NOT defer:
# double-fire is visible, zero-fire is silent.
#
# Deferral is decided by ORIGIN, not by path identity. `hooks/hooks.json` registers the plugin copy
# under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` while settings register the local one under `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`,
# so the invoking spelling is what separates them — and it stays separate when `.claude/hooks` is a
# SYMLINK to the plugin's own hooks dir, the case where both copies are one file and a path
# comparison says "I am local" for both, so neither defers and every reminder prints twice.
#
# The origin test is deliberately LEXICAL. `pwd -P` on that symlinked layout resolves the local
# copy INTO the plugin directory, which would make it look like the plugin's and restore the exact
# zero-fire this block was written to fix. The resolved comparison stays as the fallback for hosts
# that do not export CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT, and an invocation matching neither runs rather than defers.
#
# It matches the plugin hooks directory EXACTLY, never a descendant of the plugin root. Every
# `hooks/hooks.json` entry is spelled `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/<name>.sh`, so that one
# directory IS the registered surface, while a `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/*` prefix also swallows a
# project nested under the plugin root — calling the LOCAL copy the plugin's and deferring it to
# itself, which is zero-fire again. Layouts and failure directions: the request doc, issue #9.

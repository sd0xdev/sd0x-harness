# Epic Merge — Stacked PR Chain Squash-Merge

**Read first**: `@skills/push-ci/references/authorization-contract.md` before any push or merge — § Push safety for the credential, the unshared attestation and the force-with-lease rules, § Efficacy Boundary for what the per-iteration approval authorizes. If that Read fails, stop and report it; push and merge nothing.


Sequentially squash-merge a chain of stacked PRs into an epic branch, producing one squash commit per PR for clean per-PR review on the epic. Every destructive iteration is gated by `AskUserQuestion` to keep the operator in control.

## When NOT to Use

- Single PR merge — use `/create-pr` + GitHub UI
- Simple rebase without stacked dependencies — use `/smart-rebase`
- Pre-merge conflict / impact analysis only — use `/merge-prep`
- Diamond / parallel merge chains — this skill handles **linear chains only**
- Repos that use merge-commit or rebase-merge — this skill assumes squash-merge only

## Permissions

This skill is one of the explicit exceptions in `@rules/git-workflow.md` allowed to execute `git rebase --onto`, `git push --force-with-lease`, and `gh pr merge --squash`. Every destructive step is gated by `AskUserQuestion`.

| Phase | Operation | Mutates | Approval |
|-------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Phase 0 step 0 refresh | bounded `git fetch` (§ Phase 0 step 0) | `refs/remotes/origin/*` + `.git/FETCH_HEAD` | No (local, bounded, recoverable) |
| Phase 1 backup | `git tag -f` | local refs only | No (no remote / non-recoverable mutation) |
| Phase 2 iteration | rebase + force-push + `gh pr merge` | local + remote | **Yes** — single bundled gate per iteration (or per-step with `--per-step`) |
| Phase 3 verify | `git log` | none | No (read-only) |

**`--dry-run` outputs the plan and performs exactly one bounded local *operation*** — enumerated
rather than implied, because every earlier phrasing was a promise the flag did not keep. "Skips all
destructive steps" let Phase 1 run unconditionally, so a dry run force-updated every `backup/pr-*`
tag and left a manifest per PR in the working tree. The repair overcorrected: it said the run
"writes nothing" while still running `git fetch origin`, which is not a read and is not confined to
`origin/*` — see § Phase 0 step 0. And "one bounded **write**" was still too strong: a refspec
bounds which *refs* a fetch may update, not what else fetching does.

| Under `--dry-run` | Behaviour |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Phase 0 step 0 refresh | **Runs.** The one mutating operation a dry run keeps: the bounded fetch of § Phase 0 step 0, whose **ref updates** are bounded to `refs/remotes/origin/*` plus `.git/FETCH_HEAD` — its other writes are not, see § `--dry-run` residue below. Skipping it would print a plan derived from stale refs, and a wrong plan is worse than a refreshed `origin/*` |
| Phase 0 analysis | Runs — read-only, over the refs step 0 has just refreshed |
| Phase 1 `git tag -f "backup/pr-*"` | **Skipped.** Printed as a command, not executed |
| Phase 1 manifest files | **Skipped.** The `git log` runs, but its output goes to the report instead of `$(git rev-parse --git-path epic-merge)/expected-pr-*.manifest`, so no file is created and none of a previous run's are overwritten |
| Phase 2 iteration | **Skipped entirely** — no gate is asked, no rebase, no push, no merge. The commands are printed |
| Phase 3 verification | Skipped — there is nothing to verify |

The residue, stated because a dry run that leaves a trace should say where. **Refs**:
`refs/remotes/origin/*` and `.git/FETCH_HEAD` — that set is what the explicit refspec bounds.
**Objects and metadata**: a fetch that finds new commits downloads them into the object database,
and depending on configuration git may run auto-maintenance or rewrite the commit-graph on its way
out; in a shallow clone it may update the shallow metadata too. None of that is destructive and
none of it is bounded by a refspec, which is why the promise above is "one bounded operation" and
not "one bounded write". Pass `--no-auto-maintenance --no-write-commit-graph` to suppress the
maintenance half; the downloaded objects are inherent to fetching and remain. **Nothing changes on
the remote.**

## Core Concept

After squash-merging PR N, the original commits are replaced by a single squash commit on epic. PR N+1 still contains N's original commits as its base — these must be cut via `git rebase --onto` before merging N+1. The cut point is the original tip of PR N's branch, captured in Phase 1 as a backup tag.

```
epic:    E ─── S_N (squash of PR N)
PR N+1:  E ─ A1 ─ A2 ─ ... ─ B1 ─ B2
              └── drop (in S_N) ──┘ └─ keep ─┘

After: git rebase --onto origin/epic backup/pr-<N> PR_N+1
epic:    E ─── S_N ─── B1' ─ B2'
```

## Names in commands

**A PR head branch name is not display text.** It arrives from GitHub, and `git check-ref-format`
accepts far more than the names people type: measured, `refs/heads/feat/x$(printf${IFS}PWNED>&2)`
and `refs/heads/--all` both pass, `git update-ref` creates both, and `git clone` carries both to
every copy of the repository. `git switch -C` refuses to *create* such a name, which is why they
look impossible — creation is not how they arrive.

Two separate readers, and each needs its own answer:

| Reader | What a hostile name does | The answer |
|--------|--------------------------|------------|
| The **shell** | A name pasted into a command as literal text is *evaluated*: `case "feat/x$(printf${IFS}PWNED>&2)" in` runs `printf` before the guard decides anything, and the guard then passes the branch as unprotected | **Bind once to a variable** (`head=<quoted head>`), then use `"$head"`. Expanding a variable does not re-scan for `$( )` — measured both ways |
| git's **option parser** | Quotes are consumed by the shell, so git still sees `--all` as a flag. Measured: pushing such a branch without a separator answers `Everything up-to-date` — git took the flag and pushed **every** branch, none of them the one the operator approved | The **separator**, before the ref operand |

Every `<…>` slot bound above is written `<quoted …>`: substitute a **shell-quoted** value,
single-quoted with each `'` rendered as `'\''`.

**And the separator ends option parsing, not refspec parsing — a third reader with its own
answer.** After `--`, git reads the operand as a *refspec*, where a leading `+` means "force" and a
`:` splits source from destination. `git check-ref-format refs/heads/+main` exits 0, so `+main` is a
legal branch name that the protected-head guards below compare against `main` and pass as
unprotected. Measured, with a local `main` rewound behind the remote:

```
$ git push origin -- "+main"                      # no force flag anywhere on this line
 + affcbe7...ad7e970  main -> main (forced update)   # exit 0 — a protected branch, force-updated
```

It is not only a bypass, it is the wrong branch: with a real `+main` branch present, that form
pushed `main` and never created `refs/heads/+main` on the remote, while
`refs/heads/+main:refs/heads/+main` created it correctly and left `main` untouched. So both pushes
below name a **full `src:dst` refspec**, whose first character cannot be read as `+`. Write
`${head}` in braces — `$head:refs` is a modifier expansion in zsh and silently eats the `:refs`.

**Bind at the first use, not at the first destructive one.** Phase 0 reads the names and already
puts them on a command line, so a binding that started at Phase 2 would leave the whole analysis
step evaluating them. Every fenced block below that names a ref binds it at the top of that block —
each fence is its own shell, so nothing carries over between them.

**Which separator a command takes is measured, not assumed — and for one command neither works.**
Measured on git 2.55.0:

Subcommand names below are written **without** the `git ` prefix, so that naming a command in this
table is not mistaken for issuing it:

| Subcommand | Separator | Measured |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| `push`, `fetch`, `merge-base` | `--` and `--end-of-options` | **Both accepted, equivalent.** `--` here is a convention, not a correctness requirement |
| `branch -D` | `--` | `git branch -D -- --all` deletes the branch actually named `--all`; without the separator git answers `fatal: branch name required` |
| **`rev-parse`** | **neither** | `git rev-parse -- main` prints `--` and `main` back verbatim; `git rev-parse --end-of-options main` prints `--end-of-options` **and then** the SHA — two lines. Either way the captured value is not a SHA, and Step 7 would hand it to `/watch-ci` |

`rev-parse` is therefore solved by **`--verify --quiet` with a fully-qualified ref**, never by a
separator — Step 7 below uses that form.

**The `+` refspec hazard above applies to `git fetch` too**, and it is why the epic refresh in
Steps 9 and the Iteration-1 tail names a full `src:dst` refspec rather than `"$epic"`: measured,
`git fetch origin -- '+main'` reads the `+` as the force modifier and fetches **`main`**, so an epic
literally named `+main` would leave `origin/+main` stale and every later rebase would cut against
the wrong tip.

A **rev range** takes `--` too, and for a different reason than the option one. It cannot begin with
`-`, so binding does settle the *option* question — but not the revision-versus-path one. When the
range names a ref that does not resolve, git falls back to reading the whole argument as a
**pathspec**, and if a matching path happens to exist the command **succeeds**:

```
$ git log --oneline "origin/main..origin/feat"      # ref missing, path ./origin/main..origin/feat exists
f0fb083 two                                          # exit 0 — read as a path, answered about the wrong thing
$ git log --oneline "origin/main..origin/feat" --
fatal: bad revision 'origin/main..origin/feat'       # exit 128 — the failure that should have happened
```

Measured — and the same fallback catches a **single** unresolvable ref, not just a range:
`git log --oneline "origin/gone"` answers about a path and exits 0 where `… --` fatals
`bad revision`. A wrong answer with a zero exit is worse than an error here: the manifests below
are built from these arguments and then compared, so an unreadable one degrades into a mismatch
that reads as "the rebase went wrong". **Every revision argument in this document — range or
single ref — carries the separator.**

**What this section does not close**: `git switch -C "$head" "refs/remotes/origin/$head"`. No separator form
applies — git refuses an option-shaped branch name outright there, so such a head ends the run with
git's own error and no explanation from this skill. That is a failure, not an exploit, and it is not
a handled case either. Tracked in
`docs/features/ref-name-hardening/requests/2026-08-20-ref-name-hardening-r1.md`, which owns this
defect class across the ref-handling skills.

Until that redesign lands, the Phase 0 validation gate below **detects** it rather than letting it
surface mid-run: abort if any PR head begins with `-`. That is not the redesign — it neither
fully-qualifies nor escapes anything — it only moves an opaque failure to the point before backup
tags and per-iteration approvals are created, where it costs nothing to recover from. A head
beginning with `-` is legal to git (`git check-ref-format refs/heads/-x` exits 0) but unusable
here, so refusing it loses no working case.

### Phase 0: Analyze PR Chain

**Step 0 — the bounded refresh, before anything reads a ref.** Every count and validation below
is computed from `refs/remotes/origin/*`, so a refresh that runs afterwards refreshes nothing the
operator was shown. It used to sit in Phase 1, one whole approval gate too late.

`git fetch origin` is the wrong command for it, and not marginally: git applies the repository's
configured `remote.origin.fetch` refspecs, and those may write anywhere. Measured — one extra
`git config --add remote.origin.fetch '+refs/heads/feat/a:refs/heads/victim'`, then a plain
`git fetch origin`, printed `+ 425e2ea...0a77df9 feat/a -> victim (forced update)` and destroyed
a local branch. Default tag following and submodule recursion are two more write paths on the same
command. So the refresh is spelled out rather than left to configuration:

Before that, one refusal — and it precedes the refresh rather than following it, because the
refresh is itself a transport operation *that writes refs*: redirected, it does not merely
misreport the chain, it fills `refs/remotes/origin/*` from another repository, and every count,
backup tag, rebase destination and lease below is computed from exactly those refs.

```bash
# ── Step 0a: the interpreter, before anything else ────────────────────────────
# First, because every check below is only as good as the shell running it. A non-interactive bash
# SOURCES `$BASH_ENV` before line 1 of this fence; zsh does the same with `$ENV` under sh
# emulation. A sourced file may define a function whose name contains a slash — bash refuses to
# IMPORT such a name from the environment, which is why the prefix is spelled absolutely, but it
# does not refuse to DEFINE one. Measured 2026-08-22, bash 3.2.57 and zsh 5.9: with
# `function /usr/bin/env { …; }` defined, the word `/usr/bin/env` resolved to the function and the
# child never ran. Every reading this phase prints, and every attestation the iteration gates
# collect, would then be whatever that function chose to say.
#
# **This block contains no command word, and that is the design.** Two `[[ ]]` tests (a keyword the
# parser resolves — a function cannot outrank it), three assignments (syntax, not commands), one
# expansion. Round 65 rewrote it after measuring the two ways the first version failed:
#   * it read its sentinel without resetting it, so an exported `SD0X_EPIC_MERGE_REFUSED=1` satisfied
#     the expansion and the fence continued with status 0 — the refusal printed and nothing stopped;
#   * it used `${!name+set}`, bash indirect expansion, which zsh rejects as `bad substitution`
#     even under `--emulate sh` — so on macOS's default shell it aborted at the first iteration
#     whether or not anything was set, and the `ENV` refusal it documents never ran.
# Assign, THEN expand: `:?` fires on null **or** unset, so assigning empty one line above makes it
# fire unconditionally. Set-ness, not emptiness, for what is DETECTED (`${BASH_ENV+set}` — an
# exported empty value is still a file the parent named); names never values (Anchor Register #2).
#
# What this does NOT close, stated because the comment that used to stand here over-claimed: a
# startup file that defines the function and then unsets the variable leaves nothing to detect. That
# residue has no owner downstream — the `pre-push` hook is opt-in, so where it is absent the
# in-session approval is the whole credential (`rules/git-workflow.md` § Push safety).

# Transport variables decide WHERE git’s traffic goes — which repository is read from and
# written to — so nothing is planned while any of them is set. Four names, each measured 2026-08-22 on git 2.55.0 / OpenSSH 10.3p1: `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`,
# `GIT_SSH` and `GIT_PROXY_COMMAND` are run BY git AS the connection, handed the host and the
# remote command as arguments they are free to ignore; `GIT_SSH_VARIANT` names no executable at
# all but changes the argv git BUILDS — under `=plink` a URL's `:2222` is emitted as OpenSSH's
# `-P`, which takes a *tag* rather than a port (`ssh` usage: `[-P tag]`), so the connection
# silently falls back to 22.
#
# Refusing here, rather than relying on the `-u` clearing every command below carries, is this
# step's whole point. Clearing is not a neutral act: an operator's own
# `GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -p 2222'` encodes part of the destination, and dropping it moves the push
# to port 22 — which SUCCEEDS silently wherever that host serves the same path there too. Set or
# cleared, the URL and digests this phase prints would then describe a destination the push does
# not reach, which is the one thing this phase exists to prevent. The `-u` list stays as defence
# in depth, for any caller that arrives at a later phase without passing through here.
#
# Set-ness, not emptiness, is the test — measured: an exported-empty `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` is not
# treated as unset, git runs `''` as the command (`run_command: GIT_PROTOCOL=version=2 '' -G …`).
# `${VAR+set}` — the direct form, one literal test per name — is what delivers it below; the
# indirect `${!_n+set}` a loop would need is bash-only and is why the loop is gone (next
# paragraph). Names are printed and values never are: a transport
# command line routinely carries a key path (Anchor Register #2).
# Four literal tests rather than a loop over `${!_n+set}`. That is **bash** indirect expansion and
# zsh 5.9 rejects it outright — `bad substitution`, rc=1, even under `--emulate sh` — so on the
# platform's default shell the loop aborted at its FIRST iteration whether or not anything was set:
# this refusal never ran, and neither did anything below it. Measured 2026-08-22. Round 65 took the
# same construction out of step 0a and left this copy, one block away, standing.

`--refmap=` discards the configured refmap so only the refspec written here applies; `--no-tags`
and `--no-recurse-submodules` close the other two. `--upload-pack=git-upload-pack` closes a
fourth, and it is the one that decides *which repository answers*: `remote.origin.uploadpack`
names the program run at the far end, so a configured value serves refs from wherever it likes
while the URL still reads as `origin`. Measured — with `remote.x.url` pointing at a path that
does not exist and `remote.x.uploadpack` pointing at this repository, `git ls-remote x HEAD`
printed this repository's refs and exited 0; with `--upload-pack=git-upload-pack` on the
command line the same call failed 128. It is pinned on every fetch and `ls-remote` in this
document and in `/push-ci`, symmetrically with `--receive-pack=git-receive-pack` on the pushes:
a measurement and the push that acts on it must reach the same repository, and the read is the
half that had no pin. Measured against the same hostile
configuration, `victim` was left untouched. What still gets written is `.git/FETCH_HEAD` — which
is why § Arguments calls a dry run bounded rather than read-only.

Output a chain table:

| Order | PR | Head Branch | Base Branch | Unique Commits | State |
|-------|-----|-------------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| 1 | #100 | `feat/A` | `epic/xxx` | N | OPEN |
| 2 | #101 | `feat/B` | `feat/A` | N | OPEN |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Validation gate** — abort if any of:
- **The first PR's base is not `<epic-branch>`** — the linearity check below only relates each PR
  to the one before it, so PR 1 has nothing to be checked against and its base would go
  unverified. That is not a cosmetic gap: iteration 1 runs `gh pr merge <first-PR> --squash`,
  which merges into **that PR's own base**, whatever it is. A chain whose first base drifted to
  some other branch would therefore mutate that branch, and every later step would proceed on the
  false premise that `<epic-branch>` had received the commits. Compare
  `gh pr view "$first" --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName` against the requested epic branch and
  hard-abort on mismatch — before Phase 1 backups, so nothing is written first
- **Any PR's head branch name begins with `-`** — option-shaped and unusable at
  `git switch -C` (see § above); refuse before anything is written, not mid-run
- A PR's base is not the previous PR's head (chain not linear)
- Any PR is not OPEN
- Any PR has uncommitted local changes on its head branch
- Working tree is dirty (`git status --porcelain` non-empty)
- **Any PR's head branch is protected** — the default set (`main`, `master`, `develop`, `release/*`) plus the project's additions, answered by `scripts/protected-branches.sh` (exit 1 is the only "not protected"; the same resolution block Step 5 carries) — a PR
  head is not inherently unprotected (a PR can be opened *from* `main`), Step 5 force-pushes
  every head, and force push to shared branches is prohibited (`rules/git-workflow.md`
  § Prohibited). Matching is by exact name or `<prefix>/*`, so **by default** `feat/main-menu` and `release-notes` are not protected — but a project may add either, and the resolver's answer is the Phase 0 verdict exactly as it is at Step 5.
  Step 5 and Rollback re-assert this guard, so a chain that slipped past Phase 0 still
  cannot rewrite a **protected** branch. **That is not the same as "cannot rewrite a shared
  branch"**, and the difference is not pedantry: `rules/git-workflow.md` § Prohibited forbids
  force-pushing *shared* branches, and shared is a fact about who else holds the branch — not
  something any ref inspection can decide. A two-person `feat/*` head is shared and this guard
  passes it — but Step 5 no longer reaches the push unchallenged. The protected list is the
  decidable half of the shared set, chosen as the conservative side of a judgment; the
  undecidable half was an open authorization question, and it was **settled on 2026-08-21 as
  option A** in
  `docs/features/push-gate-optin/requests/2026-08-20-push-ci-force-with-lease-r5.md`:
  `pre-push-gate.sh` refuses a push that rewrites history unless the operator attests the
  rewritten refs are unshared (`ALLOW_FORCE_UNSHARED=1`, or `yes` at its `/dev/tty` prompt).
  The one exclusion is a ref the protected prompt already covers, so **no single ref is asked
  about twice**. That is the claim; "one push never asks twice" was the earlier wording and it
  overstates it — a push carrying a protected fast-forward *and* an unprotected rewrite fires both
  prompts, one per ref. This skill cannot produce such a push (it pushes one refspec per iteration),
  but the scoping argument has to be stated at the strength it actually holds, because that is the
  wording the hook’s own comment was corrected to.
  **This skill must never set that variable, and Step 5 clears it** — it is the operator’s answer,
  not the skill’s, and this workflow pushes in a loop, which is the shape session caching makes
  unsafe. Setting it answers the hook’s question; passing an ambient one through lets the shell
  answer it; only clearing it guarantees the operator is asked. Where the hook is **not** installed
  nothing at `/dev/tty` asks anything, so the per-iteration AskUserQuestion is the only attestation
  there will be — which is why the gate table asks the unshared question **by name** and first,
  rather than folding it into the force-form approval. Option A requires this skill to refuse
  without the evidence, and a question that never mentions sharedness collects approval, not
  evidence

#### On a gated repo with no controlling terminal, this skill cannot proceed — **and cannot roll back**

Every push this skill makes is a rewrite by construction (Step 5 pushes a rebased head; Rollback
rewinds one), so on a repo with the gate installed both reach `/dev/tty`. One exception, and it
falls the safe way: an iteration whose head is already based on the target rebases to a no-op, local
and remote OIDs match, git sends no ref, and the hook exits 0 without prompting — nothing was
rewritten, so nothing needed asking. "Every" is the rule for every push that changes anything.

The same `-u GIT_EXEC_PATH` that leads both push forms is not cosmetic here either: git prepends its
exec-path to PATH before running a hook, so an ambient `GIT_EXEC_PATH` chooses the `git` the gate
asks about ancestry — and a gate that mis-answers ancestry sees a rebased head as a fast-forward.
Measured on 2026-08-21: a forced update landed with exit 0 and no prompt. From an agent shell there
is no terminal to reach, and the gate refuses with `Cannot open /dev/tty …` and exit 1.

The `GIT_*` names that follow it answer the same question about **configuration and ancestry**. Three
were measured the same day: `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT` carrying `core.hooksPath=/dev/null` removes the gate
outright, the same channel carrying `url.<host>.insteadOf` sends the approved refspec to another
server, and `GIT_GRAFT_FILE` leaves the gate installed while making its `merge-base --is-ancestor`
answer "fast-forward" for a rewrite. This skill pushes in a loop, which is where an ambient one is
most dangerous: it is set once and answers every iteration.

`GIT_GRAFT_FILE=/dev/null` and `GIT_NO_REPLACE_OBJECTS=1` are **set** rather than unset — the only
two names in the prefix that work that way, and for the same reason. Unsetting `GIT_GRAFT_FILE`
restores its *default* path, `$GIT_DIR/info/grafts`, a file inside the repository that no `-u` can
reach, so the strip closes one channel by opening another (measured 2026-08-21). Unsetting the
other restores git's *default* of honouring `refs/replace/*`, so a
`git replace --graft L R` sitting in the repository makes that same ancestry oracle answer
"fast-forward" for a rewrite — while the transfer publishes the real, unrelated L, because pack
transfer ignores replacements. The gate is asked a question whose answer the push then disregards,
and that asymmetry belongs to pushing alone. Measured 2026-08-21: honest 1, grafted 0, guarded 1.

`GIT_SSH_COMMAND`, `GIT_SSH` and `GIT_PROXY_COMMAND` are stripped for a third reason, distinct from
both above: each names an executable git runs **in place of the connection**, so it decides *where
the bytes go*, not how they are authenticated. Measured 2026-08-22 on git 2.55.0 — the wrapper is
invoked as `<host> "git-receive-pack '/team/a.git'"` and is free to ignore both arguments. This skill
pushes in a loop, which is where an inherited one is worst: set once, it redirects every iteration
while Phase 0's digest, the operator's approval and the hook all still describe `origin`.
`GIT_ASKPASS` is left alone, and the distinction is measurable rather than stylistic: it is handed a
prompt and returns a credential, so it cannot choose a destination. The strip closes the
**environment** channel only — `core.sshCommand` and `url.*.insteadOf` in the repository's own config
still apply, which is both deliberate (that config is the operator's) and what keeps their key
selection working here.

The half worth stating plainly is the second one: **the recovery path is refused on exactly the same
grounds as the path that failed.** A chain interrupted mid-iteration therefore cannot be unwound from
here — the backup tag exists, and the push that would restore it is the one being refused. Do not
read the rollback failure as a second, worse fault; it is the first one seen twice.

What to do, in order:

1. **Stop the loop and report which iteration it stopped at**, plus the backup tag
   (`backup/pr-<N>`). Nothing is lost — the tag is local and the remote is untouched, because the
   refused push never happened.
2. **Point the operator at the command already written here** — Step 5's for resuming the
   iteration, Rollback's for unwinding it — to run in their own terminal, where the gate can ask
   them. **Do not restate either command in the report.** This document contains exactly two push
   commands and `test/skills/epic-merge.test.js` pins that pair by equality; a third copy written
   for a recovery note is a second source of truth for the most dangerous line in the skill, and
   the one that drifts is always the copy nobody re-reads. Name the step, quote nothing.
3. **Never set `ALLOW_FORCE_UNSHARED` or `ALLOW_PUSH_PROTECTED` to get past it** (§ Prohibited) —
   including on the rollback, where the temptation is strongest because the push looks like a repair.
   It is still a rewrite of a ref somebody else may hold, which is precisely the question nobody is
   present to answer.
4. **Never push without the full `/usr/bin/env -u` prefix, and never let one of its names
   through.** The absolute path is load-bearing: a bare `env` is shadowed by an imported
   `BASH_FUNC_env%%` function, which ignores every `-u` (measured), and `command env` is shadowed
   too because functions outrank builtins. A word containing `/` closes the **import** vector —
   bash refuses to import a function whose name contains one — but does not make the word immune:
   measured 2026-08-22, a `$BASH_ENV` file defining `function /usr/bin/env` is sourced before the
   fence's first line and intercepts the prefix in the fence's own shell (`bash -p` refuses the
   sourcing; a markdown fence cannot ask for `-p`). A shell already running attacker-chosen code
   forges `git` just as easily, which is why the terminal credential is the hook under `-p`, not
   this prefix. The
   `BASH_ENV`/`ENV` half, `GIT_EXEC_PATH`, and the `GIT_*` configuration and ancestry names. Each
   answers, from the caller's shell, a question the gate is supposed to ask now: which interpreter
   reads the hook, which `git` it consults, which configuration that `git` resolves (including
   whether the hook exists at all), and what ancestry it reports. Measured 2026-08-21 — dropping the
   configuration half alone force-updated a protected `main` at exit 0 with no gate. `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`,
   `GIT_SSH` and `GIT_PROXY_COMMAND` are in the prefix for a related but distinct reason — git runs
   each as the connection itself, so they choose *where the bytes go* (see above). `GIT_ASKPASS` is
   deliberately **not** in the prefix and must not be added: it is handed a prompt and returns a
   credential, so it cannot select a remote, and stripping it breaks the operator's credential
   helper on a push that is otherwise exactly what was approved.

### Phase 1: Pre-flight Backup

Creates safety nets. Original branch tips and PR-level commit fingerprints persist as git tags + manifest files so they survive shell session loss.

No fetch here — § Phase 0 step 0 already refreshed `refs/remotes/origin/*`, bounded. A second
fetch at this point would re-open the write paths step 0 closed and would refresh refs the
operator has already been shown a plan for, which is the reordering defect, not a safety net.

Every ref below is **fully qualified**, for the reason § Phase 0 step 0 measures: `origin/<name>`
resolves a same-named tag first, so a backup taken through the shorthand can tag the wrong commit
— and a backup of the wrong commit is worse than none, because the rollback path trusts it.

```bash
# Collision-safe backup tags keyed by PR number (NOT branch basename)
# PHASE1_OK is this fence's verdict, and it is an ASSIGNMENT for the same reason `PUSH_BLOCKED`
# is one: a refusal spelled `exit` is a refusal an imported function can swallow. `break` is an
# optimisation, never the guard — the flag is set once, cleared by any failure, and never set
# again, so the last line below states the verdict whatever the loop did after the failure.

```

**Why `backup/pr-<N>`**: branch basenames collide (`feat/foo` vs `fix/foo` both become `foo`). PR numbers are globally unique within the repo.
**Why subject-only manifest**: rebase rewrites SHAs; commit subjects are stable across rebases (assuming no `--squash`/`--fixup` mid-rebase), so subject + count is the invariant that survives the operation. **What it verifies, precisely**: that no subject went missing, got duplicated, or changed order. It says nothing about *content* — a conflict resolution, or any amend that keeps the subject, changes the tree while the `diff` stays green. So this is a **structural** check, and it is weakest exactly where it is needed most: right after manual conflict resolution. Before calling a rebased branch verified, compare the patches as well — `git range-diff "refs/tags/backup/pr-<N>...$head"` — and read the resolved hunks; on any PR whose rebase hit a conflict, CI is the evidence, not the manifest.
**Why origin refs**: local branches drift; `origin/*` is SSOT.
**Why tags**: shell variables die on session interruption; tags persist in `.git/refs/tags/`.

    echo "   Re-run the fetch by hand, confirm origin/${epic} moved, then resume (§ Recovery)." >&2
  fi
fi

# The fence's exit status. Without the first conjunct a failed squash merge is erased by the fetch
# that follows it, and the run continues into iteration 2 with PR 1 silently unmerged. Without the

```

#### Iteration 2..N — gate first, then rebase + force-push + CI + merge

For each subsequent PR (PR `<N>` with head branch `<head>`, previous PR was `<prev>`):

```bash
# PUSH_BLOCKED is this fence's own refusal record, and it exists because `exit` cannot be trusted
# to end the fence. `exit` is a builtin, so an imported `BASH_FUNC_exit%%` function outranks it —
# measured on bash 3.2.57: a refusal printed in full and the force-push then ran, exit status 0. No
# keyword terminates a shell (`return` is a builtin too), so the fix is not a better terminator: a
# refusal RECORDS itself in an assignment, and the push below is reached only through `[[ ]]`,
# which the parser resolves before any name is looked up.
# The record is FROZEN, not merely written — this paragraph used to say an assignment is something
# "nothing outranks", which confuses the command with the value. The command cannot be outranked;
# the value it wrote can be erased by whatever runs next, and under this vector that is the hostile
# function itself: `BASH_FUNC_exit%%='() { PUSH_BLOCKED=; return 0; }'` cleared the flag and the
# push ran at status 0 (measured 2026-08-22, bash 3.2.57 and 5.3.15). `readonly` at every pre-push
# refusal site below closes it — the erasing assignment, `unset` and `declare -g` each fail against
# a readonly name and the refusal held on both shells. The post-push sites that only accumulate a
# status stay plain assignments: no `exit` runs between them and the guard, so the vector needs a
# terminator it never gets. What none of this closes is injection — an environment that can define
# `exit` can define `git`, measured the same day intercepting a whole push. The record defends the
# case where the terminator alone was trusted; it was never a fence against imported functions.
# `exit 1` stays —
# in an ordinary shell it is still right, and it is no longer the only thing standing between a
# refusal and a force-push. Cleared here rather than defaulted, so an exported value of the same
# name cannot pre-approve anything either.
#
# The guard sits on its own physical line, ending in `&& \`, so the push line's own bytes stay
# out of it: everything after the `push` subcommand on that line is read as this push's argv,
# by the byte pin and by the forbidden-flag scan alike, and a guard written INTO the line would
# put words there that git never sees.
# This paragraph used to say the two force-pushes are byte-identical by design. They are not,
# and have not been since round 60 gave Step 5 an explicit `--force-with-lease=<ref>:<expect>`
# and dropped `--force-if-includes` from it — measured on git 2.55.0, the flag is a silent no-op
# once the lease carries a value. Round 75 put the rollback push on the same shape, so what
# separates them now is one variable name: `$FINAL_TIP` here, `$RB_TIP` there. What the two share
# is the refspec — an object ID on the left, under the same name, so neither publishes something
# later than what it classified — and now the lease as well, each bound to the tip its own fence
# measured. Both are
# pinned; the pins are what make the difference visible in a diff rather than something a reader

# one-way and carries no credential; `git hash-object` needs no repository. An EMPTY digest
# refuses rather than matching an empty expectation.
# One digest per push URL, SHA-256, space separated — a SET, because git invokes the pre-push hook
# ONCE PER PUSH URL with that single URL in `$2` (measured 2026-08-22). A digest of the whole list
# matches no single call, so it refused every fan-out the operator had configured and approved.
# SHA-256 rather than `git hash-object`: `rules/security.md` prohibits SHA-1 where a digest carries
# a security decision, and that prohibition is what makes the change mandatory. `hash-object` also
# follows the *repository's* object format — measured 2026-08-22, the same URL digests to
# `b354136a…` by default and `7524f1f0…` under `--object-format=sha256`, and back to the SHA-1
# value outside a repository. Round 59 corrects how much that carries: it does NOT by itself make
# the two sides disagree, since the plan side and the hook run for the same repository and read
# the same format. It is a reason not to build a cross-process binding on a tool whose algorithm
# is chosen by ambient state, and it bites where one side runs outside the repository at all.
# A URL that will not hash empties the WHOLE value rather than shortening the set: a partial set
# approves fewer destinations than the plan showed, and looks like a successful derivation.
# Round 60: SELECT the digest tool, THEN feed it. A `||` chain over a pipeline let the FIRST
# command consume stdin and then fail, after which the fallback hashed EOF. Measured 2026-08-22:
# `https://gw.example/push?repo=A&token=one` and `…?repo=B&token=two` BOTH digested to
# e3b0c442…b855 — the SHA-256 of the empty string — so two different destinations compared EQUAL
# and the destination guard passed on a destination that had changed. `command -v` does not read
# stdin, so doing the selection with it feeds the input exactly once, to exactly one tool. Same

# ⚠️ Why this is a comparison and not a push to the validated URL — the measurement, recorded so the
# swap is not proposed a third time. Round 54 declined it because a URL destination defeats
# `--set-upstream`, which does not apply here (nothing in this skill passes `-u`), and that made the
# refusal look like an accident inherited from `/push-ci`. It is not. Measured 2026-08-22: with
# `url.<B>.insteadOf=<A>` configured, a push whose destination argument was the literal URL `<A>`
# — no remote name anywhere on the line — put the ref in **B**. git
# applies the rewrite layer to a command-line URL exactly as to a remote name, so addressing the URL
# relocates the re-resolution and pins nothing. The same run shows the check is honest —
# `git remote get-url --push --all origin` reports the POST-rewrite URL, so the digest above covers
# the destination git would really use. What is left cannot be closed **by naming a destination**:
# git resolves it inside its own process, from configuration this shell cannot freeze, and every
# construct that names one goes through the same rewrite layer. The comparison sits in the SAME
# fence as the push with no question in between, so the window it narrows is the real one (the
# approval is iterations away). It was written here as "irreducible client-side", and that was
# wrong — corrected 2026-08-22: git hands the resolved destination to `pre-push-gate.sh` as `$2`,
# inside the pushing process, and `SD0X_PUSH_DEST_DIGEST` below binds against it.
# `SD0X_PUSH_DEST_DIGEST` is the other half of the destination check above, and the half that is
# not a race. The comparison a few lines up re-reads the destination in THIS shell; the push is a
# different process, so a `.git/config` edit or a `url.<x>.pushInsteadOf` landing in between still
# redirects it. git closes that window itself and hands the answer to the pre-push hook as `$2` —
# the destination it is about to reach, resolved inside the pushing process, after every rewrite.
# Measured 2026-08-22 (git 2.55.0): under `url.<B>.pushInsteadOf=<A>` a push naming `origin` gives
# `$1=origin` and `$2=<B>`, and the digest of `$2` equals the digest of `git remote get-url --push
# --all origin` byte for byte, with the rewrite and without it. Wired end to end: the rewrite was
# refused and nothing reached B; the same push carrying B's own digest went through.
#
# **This is not an ALLOW_* variable and the Prohibited list does not cover it.** Those are
# developer attestations, which is why this skill must never set them and must clear the ones it
# inherits. This one is the opposite direction: it is a constraint the skill imposes on its own
# push, it can only ever cause a refusal, and setting it inline is what stops an inherited value
# from deciding. Where the hook is not installed it does nothing at all — monotone, like
# the lease binding below (round 60): this fence no longer carries `--force-if-includes`.

# ── Step 5 topology re-check: measured AFTER the rebase, in both modes (round 59) ──────────────
# **Bundled mode decided whether an unshared attestation was owed before Step 2, and then Steps 2
# and 3 changed the very topology it predicted.** The prediction reads the remote-tracking ref;
# Step 2 checks that ref out and Step 3 rebases it. Between the prediction and the push, a
# collaborator can force-update the PR head and any background fetch can move
# `refs/remotes/origin/<head>` — after which Step 2 checks the new tip out, Step 3 drops or
# re-parents it, `--force-with-lease` sees the tip it just fetched, and `--force-if-includes`
# passes because Step 2 put that tip in this branch's reflog. § Safety already records that exact
# outcome: "a collaborator commit checked out locally and then dropped by a rewrite is overwritten
# with exit 0." A prediction is not a measurement, and the only place a measurement is possible is
# here — after the commit that will be pushed exists.
#
# This is not a second approval in the common case. It re-derives the reading and STOPS only when
# the prediction was falsified; a bundled iteration that predicted `no-rewrite` and still rewrites
# nothing passes through it silently, so the gate count in § Gate Moments is unchanged for every
# run whose prediction held.
#
# **Round 60 corrects what "falsified" means here.** The first version refused every measured
# rewrite unconditionally — including the one this iteration had ALREADY collected an unshared
# attestation for, which is the ordinary path of this whole skill: rebase, rewrite, force-push.
# It therefore stopped every normal iteration and its own advice ("re-run Step 5 on a yes") looped
# straight back into the same refusal, because the rerun measures the same rewrite. What the check
# is for is the case where the reading and the attestation DISAGREE, so it has to be able to see
# the attestation.
#
# `UNSHARED_ATTESTED` is that attestation, and it is written **literally into this fence** by the
# model from the operator's answer, exactly like `PUSH_URLS_DIGEST` below. Three properties, none
# optional: it is **never read from the environment**, so an exported value cannot answer a
# question nobody was asked (that is the whole hazard `ALLOW_FORCE_UNSHARED` carries, which is why
# this skill clears that one and does not imitate it); it is assigned **unconditionally** here, so
# an inherited value cannot survive to the test; and its default is **empty**, so a model that
# forgets to fill it in refuses the push rather than authorizing it.
# It names the REF, because that is what the operator was asked about: an attestation about
# `<head>` says nothing about any other branch, and comparing the ref is what stops it carrying.
#
# Fill it in ONLY when THIS iteration asked the unshared question by name and the operator
# answered "Nobody else works on <head>": replace the empty value below with the literal,
# quoted string "refs/heads/<head>". Every other case leaves it empty — no question asked,
# "Someone else might", an attestation collected in an earlier iteration, or one given about
# another ref. Empty refuses.

```

**Why the fence ends there.** `/watch-ci` is a skill dispatch, not a shell command. Written as a
`#` comment inside a running fence it is a line the shell skips — and every line after it then
executes regardless of what CI said, which is how a squash merge could happen with no `PASS`
verdict on a fence that reads as though it waited. The gate is the **fence boundary**: Step 8 is a
separate fence, entered only on `PASS`. On `FAIL`, on a timeout, or on any verdict that is not
`PASS` — STOP and restore from backup (§ Recovery). Fences do not share a shell, so the one below
re-establishes what it uses; that is what makes the separation mechanical rather than a promise.

### Iteration Gate Design

Default for iterations 2..N: **the unshared question, then one bundled gate** — two in total, as the
table's first row says, and one when the topology test below says the iteration rewrites nothing.
Iteration 1 has the `Proceed` question and nothing else. Operator can opt into finer control with
`--per-step`.

| Mode | Gate count per iteration (2..N) | Gate moments | When to use |
|------|--------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Bundled (default) | 2 (1 when nothing is rewritten) | The unshared question, then one bundled gate before Step 2 (covering Steps 2-9 — every step of the iteration, including the closing epic refresh) | Trusted chain, fast iteration |
| `--per-step` | 4 (3 when nothing is rewritten) | Before Step 3 (rebase), the unshared question, Step 5 (push), Step 8 (merge) | First-time use, untrusted diff, recovery from prior failure |

**The unshared question is owed only where the iteration actually rewrites something.** § Phase 2
already records the exception — an iteration whose head is already based on the target rebases to a
no-op, local and remote OIDs match, git sends no ref and the hook exits 0 without prompting — and a
gate table that asks unconditionally contradicts it, putting a rewrite to the operator that this
iteration will not perform. `rules/git-workflow.md` § Push safety measures **topology, not the
declared flag**; so does the hook. Determine it before asking, and fail closed:

| Mode | What is measurable at the moment the question is due |
|------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `--per-step` | The rebase has already run, so the outcome is observable directly: the remote tip against the rebased `HEAD` |
| Bundled (default) | The gate precedes Step 2, so the outcome must be **predicted**: does the head already sit on the target, making the rebase the no-op above |

The tests are written out rather than quoted in a table cell, and that is not presentation. The
`test/skills/epic-merge.test.js` guard that requires the canonical prefix on every git command
**deliberately does not judge table cells** — it asserts so explicitly — so a command living in a
cell is a command nobody checks. These decide whether an attestation is collected; they belong
where the guard can see them:

```bash
# Step 0's bindings are gone — this is a separate shell (§ Names in commands), and both names below
# reach a command line. Unset, `"refs/heads/${head}"` is `refs/heads/` and
# `"refs/remotes/origin/${epic}"` is `refs/remotes/origin/`: the per-step classifier reads the
# empty remote answer as a branch creation, the bundled one degrades to `unknown` because its local
# refs will not resolve, and either verdict is about an empty name rather than about the iteration
# the operator is being asked to approve.

# --per-step: after Step 3, before the push question.
# Fully qualified refs on BOTH sides. `origin/<name>` is shorthand git resolves through
# refs/tags/ before refs/remotes/, and § Backup already forbids it for exactly this reason —
# `git check-ref-format refs/tags/origin/feat-x` exits 0, so a tag of that name is legal and would
# answer this ancestry question in place of the branch.
# No pipe and no `awk`: a pipeline reports its LAST command's status, so `ls-remote | awk` exits 0
# when ls-remote fails (measured `rc=0` against a nonexistent remote) and the fail-closed reading
# below becomes unreachable; and a bare `awk` is shadowable by an imported function, which would
# emit an empty tip from real output. `${x%%<tab>*}` is expansion — no command to shadow.

# it is `git rev-parse HEAD` of whatever is checked out *now*. In bundled mode the fence runs
# BEFORE Step 2, so `HEAD` is the ambient checkout — possibly the epic branch, possibly an
# unrelated one — and the commit that will actually be pushed does not exist yet, because Step 3
# has not minted it. Reading the bundled report's `NEW_HEAD` as the approved commit therefore names
# the wrong object, which is why the bundled questions do not quote it and why the commit the push
# rewrites is established by the Step 5 re-check instead. `PUSH_URLS_SAFE` is where it lands, and
# an approval naming no destination is an approval of a push the operator cannot identify.
# The binding key the push fence compares (round 54). Redaction is lossy on purpose, so the
# redacted string cannot serve as an identity; this digest can, and it discloses nothing.
# One digest per push URL, SHA-256, space separated — a SET, because git invokes the pre-push hook
# ONCE PER PUSH URL with that single URL in `$2` (measured 2026-08-22). A digest of the whole list
# matches no single call, so it refused every fan-out the operator had configured and approved.
# SHA-256 rather than `git hash-object`: `rules/security.md` prohibits SHA-1 where a digest carries
# a security decision, and that prohibition is what makes the change mandatory. `hash-object` also
# follows the *repository's* object format — measured 2026-08-22, the same URL digests to
# `b354136a…` by default and `7524f1f0…` under `--object-format=sha256`, and back to the SHA-1
# value outside a repository. Round 59 corrects how much that carries: it does NOT by itself make
# the two sides disagree, since the plan side and the hook run for the same repository and read
# the same format. It is a reason not to build a cross-process binding on a tool whose algorithm
# is chosen by ambient state, and it bites where one side runs outside the repository at all.
# A URL that will not hash empties the WHOLE value rather than shortening the set: a partial set
# approves fewer destinations than the plan showed, and looks like a successful derivation.
# Round 60: SELECT the digest tool, THEN feed it. A `||` chain over a pipeline let the FIRST
# command consume stdin and then fail, after which the fallback hashed EOF. Measured 2026-08-22:
# `https://gw.example/push?repo=A&token=one` and `…?repo=B&token=two` BOTH digested to
# e3b0c442…b855 — the SHA-256 of the empty string — so two different destinations compared EQUAL
# and the destination guard passed on a destination that had changed. `command -v` does not read
# stdin, so doing the selection with it feeds the input exactly once, to exactly one tool. Same
# shape as `scripts/pre-push-gate.sh` § sha256_raw, deliberately: one algorithm, stated once.

| `--per-step` | `ITER_READING=up-to-date` | `REMOTE_TIP` = `NEW_HEAD`; nothing to push | No |
| `--per-step` | `ITER_READING=fast-forward` | The remote's tip is contained in what replaces it — no rewrite | No |
| `--per-step` | `ITER_READING=rewrite` | `--is-ancestor` answered no | **Yes** |
| Bundled | `BUNDLED_READING=unknown` | `LOOKUP_FAILED=1` (the push destination never resolved, so every other predicate here describes only local refs), `merge-base` exited **above 1** (it errored rather than answered), or `$CUT` or `$DEST` did not resolve. Topology **unknown, not benign** | **Yes** — fail closed |
| Bundled | `BUNDLED_READING=no-rewrite` | Ancestry succeeded **and** `$CUT` = `$DEST`: the replay is parented where it already sits, so the rebase mints no new OIDs and nothing is rewritten | No |
| Bundled | `BUNDLED_READING=rewrite` | Either ancestry answered no, or it succeeded with the cut point behind the destination — the head contains the epic tip but the replay re-parents commits. **Both are treated as a rewrite** | **Yes** |

**Ask on every row whose `Ask?` column says Yes** — that is the rule; the positions are not. This
sentence used to read "ask on the first and last rows, do not ask on the middle two", which
described a four-row table and survived the split above into a seven-row one, silently dropping two
rows that DO ask: per-step ancestry exit 1, and bundled ancestry success with an unequal cut point.
A positional instruction over an editable table is a defect waiting for the next row. The four
no-ask readings are exactly: `creation`, `up-to-date`, `fast-forward`, and bundled `no-rewrite`.

**Every row above is a partition, and the fence produces the key** (round 53). Each names one value
of `ITER_READING` or `BUNDLED_READING`, the fence assigns exactly one of each, and no run matches
two rows in its own mode — which is the property the table lacked while the rows named overlapping
*conditions* instead of a derived word. The bundled rows were the last to be converted, and they
show why the shape matters rather than merely being tidier: with `BUNDLED_ANCESTRY=0`, an
unresolved `$CUT` and a resolved `$DEST`, the old wording matched both "a ref did not resolve →
unknown" and "ancestry succeeded, `$CUT` ≠ `$DEST` → rewrite" — one state, two rows, opposite
descriptions of what was measured. The fence had always normalized that state to `unknown`; only
the table disagreed with it. Reading the rows in order is therefore not required; the previous
shape needed a precedence to be safe, and stated it only in the rollback table, where it governed a
different one. Record that reading in the
iteration's report instead, so a transcript with no unshared question is distinguishable from one
where it was skipped. The prediction in bundled mode is the weaker of the two by construction — that is the cost of
gating before Step 2. It fails toward asking **only because both of its tests are required**: until
2026-08-21 it ran the ancestry test alone, and that version failed away from asking, which is the
opposite of what this paragraph claimed. A head already containing the epic tip whose cut point sat
behind the destination read as "no rewrite", the unshared question was skipped, and the rebase then
re-parented every replayed commit. Ancestry answers *is the destination contained*; it never
answered *will the replay keep its OIDs*, and only the second question is the one being asked here.

**Iteration 1 asks neither force question.** It squash-merges the first PR directly — no rebase, no
force-push (§ Phase 2, *Iteration 1 (First PR)*) — so its gate is the `Proceed` question alone.
Asking there whether anybody else works on the head would collect an attestation for a history
rewrite that will not happen, and a per-use approval transcript is worth only what its questions
are true about. The counts above and the fields below are for iterations 2..N.

**AskUserQuestion fields (bundled mode):**

Bundled means *one gate over Steps 2-9*, and it never meant *one question*. The unshared question
is separate and asked **first**, in this mode exactly as in `--per-step`: option A obliges the
skill to refuse a force-push it has no unshared evidence for, and evidence is what a question about
sharedness collects — the `Proceed` question below collects approval, which is a different thing.
Folding the two together would also make `--per-step` the only mode that satisfies the obligation,
leaving the **default** path as the one that does not.

| # | Field | Value |
|---|-------|-------|
| 1 | `question` | `"Is anybody else working on <head>? This iteration force-pushes it to <PUSH_URLS_SAFE><basis>."` — `<basis>` is `, rewriting its remote history` on a **measured rewrite**, and `, and its topology could not be verified — treated fail-closed` on an **unknown** row. The attestation is owed either way; the factual claim is not. Telling an operator a rewrite was measured when the command that would have measured it failed asks them to authorize under a false premise, and an operator who learns the warning is often false is the one who reads past the true one |
| 1 | `options` | `Nobody else works on <head>` → continue to gate 2; `Someone else might` → **abort this PR's iteration**, do not fall through |
| 2 | `question` | `"Proceed with PR #<N> ('<title>')? Will rebase onto epic, force-push <head> to <PUSH_URLS_SAFE> with --force-with-lease<rewrite-clause>, wait for CI, then squash-merge."` — `<rewrite-clause>` is ` (a history rewrite, replacing <REMOTE_TIP>)` on a **measured rewrite**, with the **full object ID** the classifier fence printed — the value Step 5 then carries as `APPROVED_TIP` and binds the lease to, so the approval has to have shown it, exactly as the per-step `Before push` question does; on an **unknown** row, ` (topology unverified — treated fail-closed; the remote holds <REMOTE_TIP>)` whenever the classifier printed a non-empty `REMOTE_TIP` — ancestry errored, or `$CUT` or `$DEST` did not resolve, after the lookup answered — and ` (topology unverified — treated fail-closed; the remote tip could not be read)` when `LOOKUP_FAILED=1`; on a `rewrite` **or** `unknown` row whose lookup answered but found no `<head>` on the remote (empty `REMOTE_TIP`, `LOOKUP_FAILED` empty — a stale tracking ref after the head was deleted remotely), ` (the remote holds no <head> — nothing there is overwritten, and the reading could not be confirmed)`, since `replacing ` followed by nothing would name no commit at all; and ` (measured: no rewrite — the replay is already parented on the epic tip)` on the row that does not ask. A fixed clause is false for exactly the states the table just classified as harmless, and an operator taught that the warning is usually wrong reads past the one time it is not |
| 2 | `options` | `Proceed`, `Per-step approval`, `Dry-run only`, `Abort and rollback` |
| 2 | `description` per option | Show diff stats (`+X -Y across F files`), backup tag SHA, expected unique-commit count from manifest |

**One rule for the approval questions a later fence compares against** — bundled gate 2, the
per-step `Before push` question and rollback gate 2: on a reading that can lead to that comparison
(`rewrite`, and `unknown`), `<REMOTE_TIP>` is named in full whenever the classifier printed a
non-empty one. The comparison is the reason: Step 5's `rewrite` arm refuses unless `$FINAL_TIP`
equals `APPROVED_TIP`, and the rollback push compares `RB_TIP` with it the same way, so an approval
that never showed the tip cannot have covered it. When `REMOTE_TIP` is **empty** the question says
why instead — the lookup failed (`LOOKUP_FAILED=1`), or it answered that the remote holds no
`<head>` — and an empty `APPROVED_TIP` then refuses the `rewrite` arm. Readings that overwrite
nothing (`fast-forward`, `no-rewrite`, `creation`) name no tip. Of the unshared questions, the two
iteration ones (bundled gate 1, per-step `Before push (asked first)`) ask who holds the branch and
name no tip; rollback gate 1 names `<REMOTE_TIP>` as context for the same question, and keeps doing
so.

**AskUserQuestion fields (per-step mode):**

| Step | question (short) |
|------|------------------|
| Before rebase | `"Run: git rebase --onto origin/<epic> backup/pr-<prev> <head> ?"` |
| Before push (**asked first**) | `"Is anybody else working on <head>, which this pushes to <PUSH_URLS_SAFE>?<basis>"` — ` Force-with-lease rewrites its remote history.` on a measured rewrite; ` Its topology could not be verified, so this is treated fail-closed.` on an unknown row — `"Nobody else works on <head>"` continues to the question below; `"Someone else might"` **aborts this PR's iteration** rather than falling through to it |
| Before push | `"Manifest verified (N commits). Force-push <head> to <PUSH_URLS_SAFE> with --force-with-lease?<rewrite-clause>"` — one clause per `ITER_READING`: `rewrite` → ` This rewrites remote history, replacing <REMOTE_TIP>.` with the **full object ID** the classifier fence printed; `unknown` → ` Its topology could not be verified — treated fail-closed; the remote holds <REMOTE_TIP>.` when `REMOTE_TIP` is non-empty, ` Its topology could not be verified — treated fail-closed; the remote tip could not be read.` when `LOOKUP_FAILED=1`; `fast-forward` → ` Measured: no rewrite — the remote tip is an ancestor of what replaces it.`; `creation` → ` Measured: <head> is not on the remote yet — nothing is overwritten.` (`up-to-date` pushes nothing and asks nothing). A reading with no clause of its own is never folded into another: "no rewrite" on a measurement that failed asks for approval under a false premise. Same reason as bundled gate 2: the sentence is a measurement, not decoration — and naming the tip is what makes the approval reusable as a comparison, since Step 5 re-measures and refuses when the answer differs (`APPROVED_TIP`). Without the object ID the answer is "yes, rewrite something", which carries to a rewrite of anything |
| Before merge | `"CI passed for #<N>. Squash-merge into <epic>?"` |

### Cut Point Reference

Each iteration uses the **previous PR's backup tag** as the rebase cut point:

| Iteration | PR | Branch | Cut Point (--base of rebase) |
|-----------|-----|--------|------------------------------|
| 2 | #101 | `feat/B` | `backup/pr-100` |
| 3 | #102 | `feat/C` | `backup/pr-101` |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Phase 3: Verification

```bash
epic=<quoted epic>
/usr/bin/env -u BASH_ENV -u ENV -u GIT_EXEC_PATH -u GIT_DIR -u GIT_WORK_TREE -u GIT_COMMON_DIR -u GIT_INDEX_FILE -u GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY -u GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES -u GIT_NAMESPACE -u GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES -u GIT_GLOB_PATHSPECS -u GIT_ICASE_PATHSPECS -u GIT_NOGLOB_PATHSPECS -u GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS -u GIT_CONFIG -u GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS -u GIT_CONFIG_COUNT -u GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM -u GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL -u GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM -u GIT_IMPLICIT_WORK_TREE -u GIT_GRAFT_FILE -u GIT_SHALLOW_FILE -u GIT_PREFIX -u GIT_REPLACE_REF_BASE -u GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF -u GIT_SSH_COMMAND -u GIT_SSH -u GIT_PROXY_COMMAND -u GIT_SSH_VARIANT git log "refs/remotes/origin/$epic" --oneline -<N+5> --
```

Expect N squash commits (newest first), each with PR number suffix `(#NNN)`:

```
<sha> feat: ... (#103)
<sha> feat: ... (#102)
<sha> feat: ... (#101)
<sha> feat: ... (#100)
<sha> <previous epic commits>
```

Final report:

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Epic branch | `epic/xxx` |
| PRs merged | 4 (#100, #101, #102, #103) |
| Backup tags | `backup/pr-100`, `backup/pr-101`, ... (kept for safety) |
| CI status | All PASS (verdicts via `/watch-ci`) |
| Manifests | `$(git rev-parse --git-path epic-merge)/{expected,actual}-pr-*.manifest` (kept until --cleanup) |
| Gate transcripts | All AskUserQuestion answers logged in conversation |

## Safety Rules

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| One lease form on both pushes, never bare `--force` — **`--force-with-lease=refs/heads/<head>:<the tip that fence just measured>`**, `$FINAL_TIP` on the iteration push and `$RB_TIP` on the rollback push (round 60 and round 75 respectively) | Binds the credential to the object the classification was made about. The **bare** lease expects whatever `refs/remotes/origin/<head>` holds when git resolves it, so a background fetch (IDE, cron) landing a collaborator's commit there makes the lease compare against that fresh ref and the force-push **succeeds over it with exit 0** — neither the backup tag nor the manifest contains that commit, so nothing downstream notices. `--force-if-includes` used to be the answer to that, and it is not one here: it asks whether the remote tip is reachable from **any reflog entry** of the local branch, not whether the pushed history still contains it, and both of this skill's paths put that tip into the reflog themselves — Step 2 by checking it out, rollback by `git switch -C`. Measured: a collaborator's commit checked out locally and then dropped by a rewrite is overwritten with exit 0. Measured end to end 2026-08-22 on git 2.55.0 (the equivalent `/push-ci` fence, same shapes): classifier reads `C`; divergent `D` is published; a background fetch moves the tracking ref to `D`; `D` is in the branch reflog because it was committed on this branch and reset away (committing writes the branch's **own** reflog — the one the flag reads; a plain checkout of a branch that does not move writes only HEAD's) — the bare lease plus `--force-if-includes` published over `D` with exit 0, and the same tree with the classified tip as the lease value was rejected `(stale info)`. The two are **not** combined, because beside a value the flag adds nothing: git documents it as having no effect when `--force-with-lease` carries an expected value, and measured 2026-09-23 on git 2.55.0 — same shape, `D` committed on the branch and reset away so it sits in the branch's own reflog — the classified tip as lease value was refused `(stale info)` with **and** without `--force-if-includes`, while the bare lease plus the flag published over `D` with exit 0. (An earlier revision of this cell said the value-plus-flag push *succeeded* where the value alone refuses; that did not reproduce and is withdrawn.) Requires git ≥ 2.30. What the lease still does **not** prove is that the outgoing history *preserves* the remote tip; it binds the destination, not the shape of what replaces it |
| Protected head branches rejected — Phase 0, re-asserted at Step 5 and Rollback | A PR opened from `main`/`master`/`develop`/`release/*` would make the force-push rewrite a shared branch, which `rules/git-workflow.md` prohibits; "PR head" is not proof of "not protected" |
| Backup tags from `origin/*` | Remote is SSOT; local refs may be stale |
| Tags keyed by PR number | Avoids namespace collisions across branch prefixes |
| Manifest = subject + count (not SHA) | Survives SHA rewrite during rebase |
| Mismatch → STOP + restore | Backup tags enable instant rollback. **Round 60 made this executable**: it was a `#` comment under a bare `diff`, so a mismatch printed its diff and the fence pushed anyway — and `diff` is a command word an imported `BASH_FUNC_diff%%` outranks, so a forged exit 0 was equally unread. It is now `if ! /usr/bin/diff …; then` — restore, then `exit 1`, with a second message if the restore itself fails. Steps 2 and 3 gained the same treatment: a failed checkout or an interrupted rebase used to reach the push |
| CI must PASS before merge | Rebase can introduce conflicts; CI catches them |
| Update PR base before CI | CI must run against the correct epic diff |
| AskUserQuestion before destructive ops | Per `@rules/git-workflow.md` exception model |
| `/watch-ci` for CI delegation | Reuses tested timeout/verdict logic; avoids inline `gh run watch` divergence |

## Rollback

If any step fails or user aborts:

**The rollback push carries its own AskUserQuestion — it is never covered by an earlier one.**
Register #4 grants this skill `git push --force-with-lease` "after explicit per-use user approval",
and the Step 5 question (bundled gate 2's `Proceed`, or the per-step `Before push` question — § Iteration Gate Design) authorized *that*
push, with that content. A rollback rewrites the same remote ref to different content, and it can
be reached before any push question was asked at all — a Step 3 failure enters here directly. So
before the push below, ask:

**Whether the rollback push rewrites anything is a measurement, not a given.** A Step 3 failure is
reached before Step 5 pushed anything, so the remote may still hold exactly what the backup tag
names — restoring it then sends no ref and overwrites no history. Compare, do not assume:

```bash
# Step 0's bindings are gone — this is a separate shell (§ Names in commands), and both names
# below reach a command line. Unset, `"refs/heads/${head}"` is `refs/heads/`, a lookup about no
# branch whose empty answer this fence reads as a **deleted head**; and `"backup/pr-${N}^{commit}"`
# is `backup/pr-^{commit}`, which resolves nothing, so `BACKUP` empties and every valid rollback
# is classified `unknown`. Both verdicts are about an empty name rather than about the rollback
# the operator is being asked to approve, and `unknown` routes even a no-op recovery through the
# rewrite authorization path. Under an inherited `set -u` the fence aborts on `${head}` before
# classifying anything at all. This is the iteration gate's binding, in the iteration gate's
# shape, for the one classifier fence that was left without it.

# a security decision, and that prohibition is what makes the change mandatory. `hash-object` also
# follows the *repository's* object format — measured 2026-08-22, the same URL digests to
# `b354136a…` by default and `7524f1f0…` under `--object-format=sha256`, and back to the SHA-1
# value outside a repository. Round 59 corrects how much that carries: it does NOT by itself make
# the two sides disagree, since the plan side and the hook run for the same repository and read
# the same format. It is a reason not to build a cross-process binding on a tool whose algorithm
# is chosen by ambient state, and it bites where one side runs outside the repository at all.
# A URL that will not hash empties the WHOLE value rather than shortening the set: a partial set
# approves fewer destinations than the plan showed, and looks like a successful derivation.
# Round 60: SELECT the digest tool, THEN feed it. A `||` chain over a pipeline let the FIRST
# command consume stdin and then fail, after which the fallback hashed EOF. Measured 2026-08-22:
# `https://gw.example/push?repo=A&token=one` and `…?repo=B&token=two` BOTH digested to

| Result | Reading | Ask the unshared question? |
|--------|---------|---------------------------|
| `ROLLBACK_READING=unknown` | The lookup did not answer, `backup/pr-<N>` did not resolve, or `merge-base` **errored** rather than answering — a corrupt or incomplete graph, an unreadable object. Exit 1 is the answer "no"; anything above it is the absence of an answer, and the iteration table and `/push-ci` both separate the two | **Yes** — fail closed, as *unknown*, not as a measured rewrite |
| `ROLLBACK_READING=no-op` | `REMOTE_TIP` = `BACKUP`: the remote already holds the backup. Nothing is rewritten | No — and say so in the report rather than pushing |
| `ROLLBACK_READING=head-deleted` | The lookup answered and the head no longer exists on the remote. Restoring it would be a **creation**, not a rewrite | No — and do not push: report and hand back, exactly as the row above. What stops it is the rollback fence's own `case`, which refuses `head-deleted` **before** any push: re-publishing a branch somebody else deleted is a *creation*, not the rewrite the rollback approval covered. The lease is not the reason — since round 75 the rollback push binds `--force-with-lease=refs/heads/<head>:$RB_TIP`, a value-bearing form inside the grant, and an earlier revision's account of a tracking-ref lease failing with `stale info` describes a push this fence no longer issues |
| `ROLLBACK_READING=fast-forward` | The backup is a descendant of what the remote holds — an ordinary **fast-forward**. Different OIDs, no rewrite: inequality alone never was the test | No |
| `ROLLBACK_READING=rewrite` | The backup does not reach what the remote holds — the restore **rewrites** it | **Yes** |

These five are a partition, produced by the fence, exactly as the iteration table's are (round 53).
The first row used to say "**checked first**", which is what a table needs when its rows can both
match — and they could: a failed lookup and a deleted head both left `REMOTE_TIP` empty and both
made `merge-base` exit 128. Precedence now lives in the `if` chain that assigns the word, so no
reader has to apply it and no row can be reached by two different runs.

Where it is owed, the unshared question comes first here too, and the reason is sharper on this path
than on the others. Not because no gate has run — one has: bundled mode gates before Step 2 and
`--per-step` before Step 3, so a Step 3 failure is always downstream of at least one. It is that
none of them asked about **this** push. The Step 5 question authorized a rebased head; the bundled
`Proceed` covered Steps 2-9 of the iteration; an unshared attestation given for either was given
about a different rewrite of the ref, to different content. An attestation from an earlier iteration
carries even less. So a gate having run is not evidence for this push, and where the table above
says ask, there is no earlier answer to lean on.

| # | Field | Value |
|---|-------|-------|
| 1 | `question` | `"Is anybody else working on <head>? The rollback force-pushes it to <PUSH_URLS_SAFE> over <REMOTE_TIP><basis>."` — `<basis>` is `, rewriting its remote history` only when `ROLLBACK_READING=rewrite`; on `unknown` it is `, and its topology could not be verified — treated fail-closed`, and `<REMOTE_TIP>` is `an unknown tip` when the lookup itself failed rather than the empty string, which reads as a ref named nothing |
| 1 | `options` | `Nobody else works on <head>` → continue to gate 2; `Someone else might` → **stop; leave the remote as it is** |
| 2 | `question` | `"Rollback: force-push <head> to <PUSH_URLS_SAFE> back to backup/pr-<N> with --force-with-lease?<effect>"` — `<effect>` states what the classifier above measured, never one fixed sentence: ` This rewrites remote history, replacing <REMOTE_TIP>.` — with the **full object ID** the classifier fence printed — only when `ROLLBACK_READING=rewrite`; on `unknown`, ` Its topology could not be verified — treated fail-closed as a rewrite; the remote holds <REMOTE_TIP>.` whenever the classifier printed a non-empty one (a `merge-base` that errored after the lookup answered — the rollback fence compares `APPROVED_TIP` against it), and ` Its topology could not be verified — treated fail-closed as a rewrite; the remote tip could not be read.` when the lookup failed; ` The remote's tip is contained in the backup, so this is a fast-forward, not a rewrite.` on `fast-forward`. The unconditional sentence this replaced was false on exactly the rows the classifier exists to identify, and a warning the operator learns is sometimes false is the one the attestation contract cannot afford. The object ID belongs in **this** question and not only in row 1: row 1 is the attestation, and the rollback fence compares `APPROVED_TIP` against what the *approval* covered — an approval that says only "this rewrites remote history" authorizes rewriting whatever happens to be there when the push runs |
| 2 | `options` | `Restore from backup`, `Stop and leave the remote as it is` |
| 2 | `description` | Name the failed step, the backup tag SHA, and the SHA the remote currently holds |

If the operator declines, stop and report the state — but **report it, do not assert it**. Declining
stops *before* the block below, and that block is where the local restore happens (`git switch -C`
from the backup tag), so at this point neither side has been restored. An earlier version of this
line read "the local branch is restored, the remote is not", which describes a state the decline
path never reaches and would send the developer looking for a repair that was never made.

Report three measured values, each re-derived through the same normalized prefix the block below
uses, and name them as what they are:

| Value | Command | Why it is the one that matters |
|-------|---------|-------------------------------|
| Local head | `git rev-parse HEAD` | Where the working branch actually sits — mid-rebase, restored, or untouched |
| Backup tag | `git rev-parse backup/pr-<N>` | The commit a later restore would return to. A missing tag is itself the finding |
| Remote head | `git ls-remote --upload-pack=git-upload-pack -- "$PUSH_URL" refs/heads/<head>` | What everyone else sees **at the repository this push will reach**. Read from the remote, never from `origin/<head>`, which is only as fresh as the last fetch — and never from the name `origin`, which resolves to the *fetch* URL here and the *push* URL at the push |

Do not push, and do not restore. The developer decides with those three in front of them.

**Steps 1 and 2 of the block below run on every row that reaches rollback; step 3 does not.** The
clean-tree check and the local `git switch -C` restore touch nothing anybody else holds, so they
are owed even on the two rows that push nothing — `REMOTE_TIP` = `BACKUP` and a head the remote no
longer has. Those rows are exactly the ones where rollback was invoked because the *local* branch
is mid-rebase, and reading the block's prerequisite as covering all three steps would leave them
with no defined recovery at all.

```bash
# PUSH_BLOCKED is this fence's own refusal record, and it exists because `exit` cannot be trusted
# to end the fence. `exit` is a builtin, so an imported `BASH_FUNC_exit%%` function outranks it —
# measured on bash 3.2.57: a refusal printed in full and the force-push then ran, exit status 0. No
# keyword terminates a shell (`return` is a builtin too), so the fix is not a better terminator: a
# refusal RECORDS itself in an assignment, and the push below is reached only through `[[ ]]`,
# which the parser resolves before any name is looked up.
# The record is FROZEN, not merely written — this paragraph used to say an assignment is something
# "nothing outranks", which confuses the command with the value. The command cannot be outranked;
# the value it wrote can be erased by whatever runs next, and under this vector that is the hostile
# function itself: `BASH_FUNC_exit%%='() { PUSH_BLOCKED=; return 0; }'` cleared the flag and the
# push ran at status 0 (measured 2026-08-22, bash 3.2.57 and 5.3.15). `readonly` at every pre-push
# refusal site below closes it — the erasing assignment, `unset` and `declare -g` each fail against
# a readonly name and the refusal held on both shells. The post-push sites that only accumulate a
# status stay plain assignments: no `exit` runs between them and the guard, so the vector needs a
# terminator it never gets. What none of this closes is injection — an environment that can define
# `exit` can define `git`, measured the same day intercepting a whole push. The record defends the
# case where the terminator alone was trusted; it was never a fence against imported functions.
# `exit 1` stays —
# in an ordinary shell it is still right, and it is no longer the only thing standing between a
# refusal and a force-push. Cleared here rather than defaulted, so an exported value of the same
# name cannot pre-approve anything either.
#
# The guard sits on its own physical line, ending in `&& \`, so the push line's own bytes stay
# out of it: everything after the `push` subcommand on that line is read as this push's argv,
# by the byte pin and by the forbidden-flag scan alike, and a guard written INTO the line would
# put words there that git never sees.
# This paragraph used to say the two force-pushes are byte-identical by design. They are not,
# and have not been since round 60 gave Step 5 an explicit `--force-with-lease=<ref>:<expect>`
# and dropped `--force-if-includes` from it — measured on git 2.55.0, the flag is a silent no-op
# once the lease carries a value. Round 75 put the rollback push on the same shape, so what
# separates them now is one variable name: `$FINAL_TIP` here, `$RB_TIP` there. What the two share
# is the refspec — an object ID on the left, under the same name, so neither publishes something
# later than what it classified — and now the lease as well, each bound to the tip its own fence
# measured. Both are
# pinned; the pins are what make the difference visible in a diff rather than something a reader
# has to notice.

# host and a path — and a `.git/config` edit between the question and the push then redirects an
# approved history rewrite to another repository with this guard still passing. The digest is
# one-way and carries no credential; `git hash-object` needs no repository. An EMPTY digest
# refuses rather than matching an empty expectation.
# One digest per push URL, SHA-256, space separated — a SET, because git invokes the pre-push hook
# ONCE PER PUSH URL with that single URL in `$2` (measured 2026-08-22). A digest of the whole list
# matches no single call, so it refused every fan-out the operator had configured and approved.
# SHA-256 rather than `git hash-object`: `rules/security.md` prohibits SHA-1 where a digest carries
# a security decision, and that prohibition is what makes the change mandatory. `hash-object` also
# follows the *repository's* object format — measured 2026-08-22, the same URL digests to
# `b354136a…` by default and `7524f1f0…` under `--object-format=sha256`, and back to the SHA-1
# value outside a repository. Round 59 corrects how much that carries: it does NOT by itself make
# the two sides disagree, since the plan side and the hook run for the same repository and read
# the same format. It is a reason not to build a cross-process binding on a tool whose algorithm
# is chosen by ambient state, and it bites where one side runs outside the repository at all.
# A URL that will not hash empties the WHOLE value rather than shortening the set: a partial set
# approves fewer destinations than the plan showed, and looks like a successful derivation.
# Round 60: SELECT the digest tool, THEN feed it. A `||` chain over a pipeline let the FIRST
# command consume stdin and then fail, after which the fallback hashed EOF. Measured 2026-08-22:
# `https://gw.example/push?repo=A&token=one` and `…?repo=B&token=two` BOTH digested to
# e3b0c442…b855 — the SHA-256 of the empty string — so two different destinations compared EQUAL
# and the destination guard passed on a destination that had changed. `command -v` does not read
# stdin, so doing the selection with it feeds the input exactly once, to exactly one tool. Same
# shape as `scripts/pre-push-gate.sh` § sha256_raw, deliberately: one algorithm, stated once.
sha256_raw() {   # reads stdin, writes the selected tool's own output line; nonzero only if none exists
  # Invoked through `/usr/bin/env`, never as a bare word. `command -v` reports an imported shell
  # function as a perfectly good command, and the known-answer test below only rejects a tool that
  # answers one CONSTANT. An ADAPTIVE function passes both vectors and then returns one fixed
  # digest for every real URL, so two different destinations compare EQUAL and the approval is
  # bound to nothing. `env` resolves PATH only, and bash refuses to import a function whose name
  # contains a slash, so a function-only match makes `env` fail and the test below correctly
  # empties the digest. `scripts/pre-push-gate.sh` needs no such spelling and is not inconsistent

  # these fences have no shebang of their own. The defence differs because the channel does.

# 60, both of which decided nothing here because neither value existed in this fence.

# (a) The classifier's own verdict. The table above sends `no-op` and `head-deleted` through the
# LOCAL restore and says, in both rows, do not push. Nothing in this fence read that: the only
# push predicates were an empty `PUSH_BLOCKED` and a non-empty `PUSHED`, and both are true on
# those rows. So a `head-deleted` reading — somebody else deleted this branch — reached a
# force-push that can recreate it, and `no-op` reached one that publishes what the remote already
# holds. Bound the way `PUSH_URLS_DIGEST` is bound just above, because a fence is a separate
# shell and a value the classifier printed is not in it (§ 4.52, § 4.54: the harness supplying
# what the fence should bind is how the same class survived a whole round of tests).
ROLLBACK_READING=<the ROLLBACK_READING value the classifier fence printed for this iteration, written literally and quoted>
UNSHARED_ATTESTED=<empty unless the operator answered YES to the unshared question for this rollback; then the literal string refs/heads/ followed by the head branch name, written literally and quoted>
# The remote tip the pre-restore classifier PRINTED as `REMOTE_TIP=[...]` — bound here for the
# same reason as the two fields above, and it earns its place more plainly in this fence than in
# Step 5's: `rewrite` is the ORDINARY reading for a rollback, because the backup by construction
# does not contain the head this skill just pushed. So the reading alone cannot tell "undoing our
# own push" from "somebody else published on top of it", and the tip is what separates them.
APPROVED_TIP=<the REMOTE_TIP value the pre-restore classifier fence printed for this iteration, written literally and quoted>

# **Round 75: the lease now carries the tip part (b) measured**, the shape Step 5 has had since
# round 60, and `--force-if-includes` goes with the bare form it was compensating for. The
# previous wording called the value-less lease the stronger anchor, on the grounds that it leases
# against `refs/remotes/origin/<head>` — the tip the last fetch saw — and so refuses anything
# pushed since. That premise is only as good as "nothing re-fetches": a background fetch moves
# that ref, after which the lease expects the collaborator's commit and the push overwrites it,
# and `--force-if-includes` does not stop it because `switch -C` put the branch's previous OID in
# the reflog it certifies against. Measured end to end 2026-08-22 (git 2.55.0) on the equivalent
# `/push-ci` fence: the bare pair published over a divergent `D` with exit 0 while the only
# classification anybody saw said `fast-forward`; the same tree with the classified tip as the
# lease value was rejected `(stale info)`. Binding to `$RB_TIP` also makes the credential and the
# classification name **one** object — the property this whole file keeps asserting elsewhere.
# The user's 2026-08-22 ruling settles the authorization question the old wording deferred to:
# `--force-with-lease=<ref>:<expect>` is the granted flag in its value-bearing form, not a
# separate grant. What is **not** reopened by that ruling is the creation row: re-publishing a
# branch somebody else deleted is not the rewrite rollback was asked to undo, so it is refused in
# the `case` above on that ground alone. Exactly three rows reach this line: `up-to-date` and
# `fast-forward` unconditionally, and `rewrite` once `UNSHARED_ATTESTED` names this ref. On all
# three the remote still holds <head>, so `$RB_TIP` is non-empty and the lease value can never
# collapse into the "this ref must not exist yet" form by accident.
# `SD0X_PUSH_DEST_DIGEST` is the other half of the destination check above, and the half that is
# not a race. The comparison a few lines up re-reads the destination in THIS shell; the push is a
# different process, so a `.git/config` edit or a `url.<x>.pushInsteadOf` landing in between still
# redirects it. git closes that window itself and hands the answer to the pre-push hook as `$2` —
# the destination it is about to reach, resolved inside the pushing process, after every rewrite.
# Measured 2026-08-22 (git 2.55.0): under `url.<B>.pushInsteadOf=<A>` a push naming `origin` gives
# `$1=origin` and `$2=<B>`, and the digest of `$2` equals the digest of `git remote get-url --push
# --all origin` byte for byte, with the rewrite and without it. Wired end to end: the rewrite was
# refused and nothing reached B; the same push carrying B's own digest went through.
#
# **This is not an ALLOW_* variable and the Prohibited list does not cover it.** Those are
# developer attestations, which is why this skill must never set them and must clear the ones it
# inherits. This one is the opposite direction: it is a constraint the skill imposes on its own
# push, it can only ever cause a refusal, and setting it inline is what stops an inherited value
# from deciding. Where the hook is not installed it does nothing at all — monotone, the same
# property the lease value above has: both can only ever turn a push into a refusal.

## Conflict Handling

**A conflict ends Claude's execution of the chain.** The Anchor grant in `@rules/git-workflow.md`
is the exact form `git rebase --onto` — `--continue`, `--abort` and `--skip` are not on it, and a
grant for one rebase form is not a grant for the family. So the skill stops with the repository
mid-rebase, prints the commands below, and the developer runs them:

```bash
# resolve the conflicted paths, then:

Re-verify the manifest after the developer reports the rebase finished (subject set must match)
before offering to continue the chain. Resuming without that check merges an unverified tree.

## Resume / Checkpoint (long chains)

For chains of 10+ PRs, mid-failure recovery without restart:

1. Determine where the chain stopped — the binding and its use go in **one** block, because two
   inline spans are two shells and the second would expand an unset (or ambient) `$epic`
   (§ Names in commands):

   ```bash
   if ! /usr/bin/env -u BASH_ENV -u ENV -u GIT_EXEC_PATH -u GIT_DIR -u GIT_WORK_TREE -u GIT_COMMON_DIR -u GIT_INDEX_FILE -u GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY -u GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES -u GIT_NAMESPACE -u GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES -u GIT_GLOB_PATHSPECS -u GIT_ICASE_PATHSPECS -u GIT_NOGLOB_PATHSPECS -u GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS -u GIT_CONFIG -u GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS -u GIT_CONFIG_COUNT -u GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM -u GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL -u GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM -u GIT_IMPLICIT_WORK_TREE -u GIT_GRAFT_FILE -u GIT_SHALLOW_FILE -u GIT_PREFIX -u GIT_REPLACE_REF_BASE -u GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF -u GIT_SSH_COMMAND -u GIT_SSH -u GIT_PROXY_COMMAND -u GIT_SSH_VARIANT git tag -l 'backup/pr-*'; then
     echo "⛔ resume: the backup tags could not be listed. They are the cut points this whole" >&2
     echo "   step reads, so an empty listing and an unreadable one mean opposite things. STOP." >&2
     SD0X_EPIC_MERGE_REFUSED=
     : "${SD0X_EPIC_MERGE_REFUSED:?refusing — the backup tags could not be listed}"
   fi
   epic=<quoted epic>
   # Captured, then filtered — never `git log … | grep …`. A pipeline exits with its LAST
   # stage's status, and `grep` is a bare word an imported function can claim, so a forged
   # merged-PR list returns 0 over a `git log` that fataled. Read the two statuses apart:
   # grep exit 1 is "no match", a valid empty answer here; anything above 1 is grep failing.

     : "${SD0X_EPIC_MERGE_REFUSED:?refusing — the epic log could not be read}"
   fi
   # The `if` carries the status for the reason Step 5 above states: under an inherited
   # `errexit` a following capture line never runs, and grep exit 1 — no merged PRs yet — is
   # the ordinary first resume rather than a failure.
   if MERGED_PRS=$(/usr/bin/grep -E '\(#[0-9]+\)' <<< "$EPIC_LOG"); then GREP_STATUS=0; else GREP_STATUS=$?; fi
   if [[ $GREP_STATUS -gt 1 ]]; then
     echo "⛔ resume: the merged-PR filter itself failed (exit ${GREP_STATUS}). STOP." >&2

   /usr/bin/printf '%s\n' "$MERGED_PRS"
   ```

2. **Cut the first remaining PR over to the epic yourself — Phase 0 will not do it, and will abort
   until you have.** There is no already-merged detection anywhere in this skill: Phase 0 aborts on
   any PR that is not OPEN, and separately requires the **first** listed PR's base to equal
   `<epic-branch>`. After an interruption the first still-open PR is based on the *previous* PR's
   head, so a bare re-invocation hits that second abort. Worse, if you retarget the base and stop
   there, Phase 0 accepts the chain and Iteration 1 runs a **direct squash with no rebase** — the
   already-merged commits of the previous PR would land on the epic a second time. So do both, in
   this order, before re-invoking:

   ```bash
   epic=<quoted epic>; head=<quoted first-remaining-head>; prev=<quoted previous-merged-PR-number>
   # a. Refresh the epic's remote-tracking ref, THEN rebase off the previous PR's backup tag —
   #    that tag IS the cut point. The destination must be the remote epic: step 1 above says the
   #    previous PR was squash-merged into `origin/$epic`, so that is where the new tip lives.

     echo "⛔ resume: refreshing refs/remotes/origin/${epic} failed. The rebase below would use" >&2
     echo "   the stale tip and the force-push would write it out. Fix the fetch first. STOP." >&2

3. Re-invoke `/epic-merge <epic> <remaining-PRs>`, listing **only the still-open PRs**. Iteration 1's
   direct squash is now correct, because step 2 already performed the rebase it does not do.
4. Backup tags from prior session remain valid as long as the corresponding branches have not been
   re-pushed — step 2a re-pushes the first remaining head, so re-tag it if you interrupt again.

## Arguments

| Argument | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `<epic-branch>` | Target epic branch name | Required |
| `<PR-list>` | Comma-separated PR numbers | Auto-detect from chain |
| `--dry-run` | Show plan + commands; performs one bounded local fetch — remote unchanged, but see § `--dry-run` for the local residue (objects, `FETCH_HEAD`, possible auto-maintenance) | off |
| `--per-step` | Four gates per iteration **2..N** (rebase / unshared question / push / merge); iteration 1 is unaffected — it has no rebase and no force-push | off (the unshared question plus one bundled gate) |
| `--cleanup` | Delete local branches, backup tags and manifests after success — backup tags stay with `--keep-backup-tags` | off |
| `--keep-backup-tags` | Keep backup tags even with --cleanup | off |
| `--ci-timeout <min>` | Timeout passed to `/watch-ci` | 15 |

## Examples

```bash
# Auto-detect chain into epic branch (iteration 1: one gate; iterations 2..N: unshared question + bundled gate)
/epic-merge epic/gas-account-OK-49808

# Dry-run to see plan first
/epic-merge epic/feature-xxx --dry-run

# Explicit PR list with finer per-step gates (first-time use)
/epic-merge epic/feature-xxx 100,101,102,103 --per-step

# Full cleanup after success
/epic-merge epic/feature-xxx --cleanup
```

## Prerequisites

- `gh` CLI authenticated (`gh auth status`)
- Repository uses squash-merge only (GitHub repo setting)
- All PRs in the chain are OPEN and CI passing on their current base
- Working tree clean (`git status --porcelain` empty)
- Backup tag namespace `backup/pr-*` not already in use for unrelated purposes

## Limitations

- Linear chains only (no diamond / parallel merges)
- Squash-merge repos only
- One epic branch per invocation
- CI delegation requires `/watch-ci` to be available

## Verification

- [ ] Phase 0: Chain validated as linear, all PRs OPEN, working tree clean
- [ ] Phase 1: Backup tags created from `origin/*` refs, keyed by PR number
- [ ] Phase 1: Per-PR subject-only manifests written
- [ ] Phase 2: AskUserQuestion answer recorded BEFORE the first destructive op of each iteration
- [ ] Phase 2: no push command contains the bare `--force` flag (token-level check, not substring — `--force-with-lease` is allowed); the **iteration** push carries `--force-with-lease=refs/heads/<head>:$FINAL_TIP` and no `--force-if-includes` (the flag is a documented no-op beside a lease value — § Safety), the **rollback** push carries `--force-with-lease=refs/heads/<head>:$RB_TIP` and no `--force-if-includes` either (round 75 — same reason, and § Safety records why the flag was never live on that path)
- [ ] Phase 2: `/watch-ci` invoked with `--sha <sha> --branch <head>`; PASS verdict received before `gh pr merge`
- [ ] Phase 2: Manifest `diff` exits 0 after each rebase
- [ ] Phase 3: Final epic log shows N squash commits with `(#NNN)` suffix in expected order
- [ ] No commit/push performed without an AskUserQuestion answer in the conversation transcript

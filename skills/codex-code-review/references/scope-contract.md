# Scope Contract — the review plane's authoritative procedure

Loaded on demand. `rules/scope-discipline.md` carries the resident guard — the semantics a session
needs *before* it knows it is reviewing anything. This file carries the mechanics: how the baseline
is computed and frozen, how a finding's scope is derived from reviewer fields, what the circuit
breaker measures, and which dispositions are valid. Load it on any of the six triggers listed
under "Where the two layers overlap" below — the canonical set; this paragraph does not restate it.

Every rule here was resident prose until 2026-08-29 and **the move changed no policy**
(`docs/features/rules-residency/2-tech-spec.md` § 3.4). Prose edits made in the move, so a reader
need not diff to find them: § Records now points at the resident literals instead of restating
them; § Anchor Compatibility gained the "resolve at step 0 / not new Register items" sentence back;
§ Gate Derivation was reworded where it forwarded to the review skill; two citations were
de-qualified to avoid a skill-permission edge; and one citation in § Closed-Set Options was
requalified to its repo-rooted path so the routing guard can resolve it.

**Where the two layers overlap, this file is canonical.** `rules/scope-discipline.md` § Resident Guard
and its § Load the full contract when state the same anchors and the same load triggers in summary
form, because a session must
carry them before it knows it needs this file; any disagreement between them is a defect in the
summary. The load triggers are the six that guard lists: a finding or edit outside the frozen
baseline · scope is `uncertain` · a review round is being dispatched or its gate derived · the
circuit breaker may have tripped · an E1 disposition is being created or validated · an
opportunistic candidate is being admitted or deferred.

## Scope Baseline (task-level, immutable)

The baseline file set is computed **once**, at Step 1 of the task's first review round
(§ Step 1 of `codex-code-review`'s workflow), then **frozen for the whole review session** —
initial reviewer, inline secondary, `--continue`, and every same-task re-dispatch read the same
frozen list; no path may recompute it.

| Variant | Baseline set |
|---------|-------------|
| `/codex-review-fast`, `/codex-review` | `git diff --name-only HEAD` ∪ untracked (`git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`) |
| `/codex-review-branch` (incl. `--dual`) | `git diff --name-only $(git merge-base ${BASE_BRANCH} HEAD)` ∪ the same uncommitted + untracked set |

`${BASE_BRANCH}` resolution: explicit argument first; else `git symbolic-ref --short
refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`; else `origin/main` — each candidate verified with `git rev-parse
--verify` before use. All candidates failing is a **parameter error**: abort the branch review and
ask for an explicit base — never proceed on an empty baseline (an empty baseline would misread
every unmodified file as out-of-scope). The abort is not a human exit. The resolved base and the
frozen list are written into the review report metadata.

The **only** update path is the explicit scope expansion of § Closed-Set Options option 1, and it
is a **monotonic precise union**: `baseline := baseline ∪ files the user explicitly named` (plus
per-file additions from a separately approved compatibility analysis). **Never re-run the
discovery commands**: re-scanning the now-dirty diff would absorb every file earlier fixes touched,
turning a one-file authorization into all dirty files — reopening exactly the sweep this rule
exists to close. Ordinary edits during a round never write back into the baseline.

## Scope Determination (mechanical — any one condition ⇒ in-scope)

1. **The file is in the baseline set** — pure set membership.
2. **The defect sits on a call path the baseline diff directly touches** — **one hop only**: a
   direct caller or direct callee of a symbol the diff modified, with the call site cited as
   `file:line`. No transitive expansion (one hop of one hop does not count). No citable call
   site → `uncertain`.
3. **The defect was introduced by this branch** — evidenced via `git log -L` / `git blame` showing
   the introducing commit on the branch.

`uncertain` is **fail-closed: treated as in-scope** for both gate and fixing. Misreading
pre-existing as in-scope costs a little extra fixing, capped by the circuit breaker; misreading a
branch-introduced defect as out-of-scope ships it. The asymmetry decides. Declaring out-of-scope
requires **complete negative evidence**: all three conditions individually shown false (not in the
baseline, no one-hop call site, not branch-introduced) — any missing negative ⇒ `uncertain`.

Non-code files (`.md`, config, data) have no call paths: only conditions 1 and 3 apply;
condition 2 is always negative.

## Behavior Table

"Critical" below = P0, or a security/data-integrity finding.

| Finding | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| in-scope ∧ **owed** (§ Opportunistic Envelope: `mandatory` ∧ ≥ tier blocking severity, **or** `admitted` at any severity) | Fix per § Fix Obligation below — zero tolerance unchanged |
| in-scope ∧ ≥ tier blocking severity ∧ `fix_obligation=deferred` | Record `[OPPORTUNISTIC_DEFERRED]`; **does not block `✅ Ready`**. Reachable only for a proven opportunistic candidate (§ Opportunistic Envelope) |
| in-scope ∧ sub-threshold ∧ **not** `admitted` | Existing `[NIT_DEFERRED]` mechanism, unchanged. An `admitted` sub-threshold finding is **not** in this row — it is owed, and the fix row above routes it |
| out-of-scope ∧ not critical | Record `[OUT_OF_SCOPE_DEFERRED]`, summarize once at task end; **does not block `✅ Ready`** |
| out-of-scope ∧ critical ∧ no valid `[USER_SKIPPED]` | Gate reads `⛔ Blocked` with `gate_reason=OUT_OF_SCOPE_CRITICAL`; the model does **not** enter the fix loop — human exit E1 (closed-set options); a pass must not be noted |
| out-of-scope ∧ critical ∧ valid `[USER_SKIPPED]` | Authorized deferral: excluded from the gate's second disjunct; listed under the report's "Out-of-Scope Findings" section with its disposition |
| user explicitly says "fix it together" | Scope expansion: the named files become in-scope from then on and get full review |

## Opportunistic Envelope

Scope says whether a finding is *this task's to look at*; severity says how bad it is. Neither asks
whether the primary change can afford to fix it **now**. `fix_obligation` is that third answer, and
it is derived orchestration-side from the reviewer's fields — never reported by a reviewer, which is
never told an envelope exists.

**Candidate predicate.** A finding is an *opportunistic candidate* only when all of:

```
origin = pre-existing
∧ normalized_scope = in-scope
∧ scope_reason ∈ {diff-file, one-hop}
∧ change_relation = independent, with the primary hunk(s) cited
∧ severity ∉ {P0} ∧ the finding is not a security or data-integrity defect
```

Everything else is `mandatory`, and so is every failure to establish the above: a missing or unknown
`change_relation`, a contradiction (`origin=in-diff ∧ independent`, `branch-introduced ∧
independent`), an `independent` with no hunk citation, or a dual aggregate where any source read
`affected` or `uncertain`. Compatibility work on a direct caller whose signature or semantics this
branch changed is `affected` by construction, so the helper-sweep boundary above is untouched.

**Obligation set.**

| `fix_obligation` | When |
|------------------|------|
| `mandatory` | Not a valid candidate, or the evidence for candidacy is missing or contradictory (fail-closed) |
| `admitted` | A valid candidate the model takes into a fix phase **a mandatory blocking finding already opened**, within the envelope's capacity |
| `deferred` | A valid candidate not admitted — the envelope is closed or exhausted, the footprint does not fit, the breaker has tripped, or no fix phase is open |

**Worked cases.** The predicate and the obligation table decide these; the table exists so a
reader can check a derivation against a named case rather than re-deriving it:

| Finding | Obligation | Gate effect |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| `pre-existing` in a baseline file, `change_relation=independent` with hunks, P1 | candidate → `deferred` while the envelope is closed | recorded `[OPPORTUNISTIC_DEFERRED]`; **does not block** |
| `pre-existing` in a direct caller (`scope_reason=one-hop`), `change_relation=independent` with hunks, P1 | candidate → `deferred`/`admitted` | adjacency alone never forces `mandatory` |
| `pre-existing` in a direct caller, `change_relation=affected` (this branch changed the signature it calls) | `mandatory` | blocks at or above the tier's blocking severity |
| `origin=in-diff` reported with `change_relation=independent` | `mandatory` (contradiction → `uncertain`) | blocks at or above the tier's blocking severity — `mandatory` restores the ordinary severity rule, it does not bypass it; the contradiction is never resolved in the candidate's favour |
| A candidate admitted into an open fix phase, P2 under `standard` | `admitted` — **phase-scoped** | owed for that phase: the phase does not re-dispatch while it is unfixed, though the same finding unadmitted would be sub-threshold. The verifying re-review derives it afresh from **its own** fields: a candidate again → `deferred`, recorded, only if that fresh report still proves it one (pre-existing, independent with hunks, not P0 / security / data-integrity); any other fresh classification derives `mandatory`. Never blocking on the strength of an earlier admission, never dropped |
| Dual review: one source `independent`, the other `uncertain` | `mandatory` | the conservative merge wins |

**The term `owed` — defined canonically here, mirrored in the named carriers.** A finding is **owed** when:

```
owed(f) ⇔ in-scope(f) ∧ ( (fix_obligation(f)=mandatory ∧ severity(f) ≥ tier_blocking)
                        ∨  fix_obligation(f)=admitted )        -- admitted carries no severity bound
```

Every routing site — the merge gate, the review loop, the circuit breaker, human exit E2, the
late-secondary and Codex-down reconciliations, the fallback carrier — decides on **this** predicate.
The sites in `SKILL.md` and `review-common.md` **mirror** it in their own words so a reader there
need not load this file, and the two **resident** rules files (`rules/scope-discipline.md`,
`rules/auto-loop.md` § Fix Obligation) expand it because a session carries them before it has loaded this
contract; this definition is the one each mirror is checked against. The mirrors are what nine
review rounds kept finding: each prose copy is a chance to drop the `admitted` disjunct or to
re-bound it by severity, and a dropped disjunct is an owed finding leaving the gate — which is why
every mirror is test-pinned to this form.

**An admitted finding is owed for the fix phase it was admitted into, whatever its severity.**
Admission is the model's own commitment inside an open phase, so an admitted P2 under `standard`
holds that phase open exactly as a mandatory P1 does — the same finding, unadmitted, would have
been sub-threshold — and the phase does not re-dispatch while it is unfixed (Fixing ≠ Verifying:
the re-review is what verifies the attempt). The commitment ends with the phase: the verifying
re-review derives every finding afresh, so an admitted finding whose fix turned out ineffective is
reported again and derived afresh — a candidate, **recorded**, if the fresh report still proves it
one, and `mandatory` under any other fresh classification (`affected`, `uncertain`, P0, security,
data-integrity) — so it does not stay Blocked on the strength of an earlier admission, and it is
never silently dropped. That is the deliberate cost of keeping
no cross-round state (2026-09-03 decision); a change that wants a persisting admitted debt has the
existing scope-expansion path (§ Closed-Set Options option 1), which makes the finding mandatory.

**No opportunistic-only round.** A report that would derive `✅ Ready` is never re-opened to admit a
candidate, and the sub-threshold on-the-spot fixes (`@rules/auto-loop.md` § Sub-Threshold Findings)
never reach a `deferred` candidate either — a one-line candidate fixed "on the spot" is exactly the
opportunistic-only round in miniature. The envelope grants capacity; it never creates work.

**The obligation is derived afresh every round, never carried.** A reviewer never reports
`fix_obligation`, and it is deliberately **not** added to the re-review prompt's disposition list:
telling a reviewer that a finding was already judged independent anchors the very
`change_relation` re-evaluation the next round asks for. Nor is it carried orchestration-side
across rounds — v1 keeps no per-finding obligation state at all. Each report, whether a same-thread
reply, a rotated thread or a stateless fallback re-dispatch, is normalized and derived on its own
terms, so a candidate first reported on round three is a candidate, a finding whose evidence has
changed is re-judged on the new evidence, and no obligation can be lost in a mapping between rounds
because no obligation is mapped. After a **thread rotation or a stateless fallback re-dispatch**
the round's finding set is the fresh report plus the old thread's unclosed findings that were
**not** fixed and the fresh reviewer did **not** re-find (`review-common.md` § Thread Rotation
step 3). Those re-enter with their identity and severity only: their `change_relation` and its
evidence are stale — the diff may have moved since they were judged — so they re-enter as
`uncertain` and derive `mandatory` until a reviewer re-classifies them. Findings are carried;
obligations and current-dependent judgments are not. What `admitted` means under this rule is **phase-scoped**: a candidate
admitted into an open fix phase is owed for that phase, and the phase is not closed — no re-review
is dispatched — while an admitted finding remains unfixed (Fixing ≠ Verifying). If it is still
present in the next report it is derived afresh there from that report's own fields — a candidate,
recorded, only while that report still proves it one; `mandatory` under any other fresh
classification (`affected`, `uncertain`, P0, security, data-integrity); it is never silently
dropped. Carrying obligation across rounds was tried and withdrawn on 2026-09-03: it
needed an eight-row precedence table that ten review rounds could not make total and sound, for a
property the ticket never asked for.

**Deferral is not dismissal.** The finding stays actionable and stays in the report — what is
deferred is only this change's obligation to fix it. It carries no `[DISMISS_VERDICT]`, needs no
`/seek-verdict` blind check, and `/codex-review-branch` re-finds it when the change is next reviewed
at depth. A later round revalidates the **whole** candidate predicate, not the relation alone: a
`change_relation` of `affected` or `uncertain`, a severity that has risen to P0, a defect now
recognised as security or data-integrity, or evidence that no longer cites a primary hunk each
invalidate the deferral and make the finding `mandatory` — automatically, because the obligation
is derived from that round's report and never carried in.

**Envelope capacity** — how large the candidate budget is for a given change, and how it is latched
from the primary change's risk — is not defined here yet. Until it is, the envelope is **`closed`**:
every candidate derives `deferred`, and the classification above is what makes that a recorded
decision rather than an invisible one.

## Records (reporting conventions)

Both mirror `[NIT_DEFERRED]` (@rules/auto-loop.md § Sub-Threshold Findings): emitted at column 0
with the field order fixed, greppable in reports and transcripts — **no TTL, no hook parsing, no
persistence**. The durable record is the review report and the conversation; every same-task
re-review prompt carries the currently valid dispositions, and `/codex-review-branch` re-finds
what is still true when it reviews at depth. Records must never contain secrets, tokens, or
passwords (Anchor Register #2).

The five literal field orders — `[OUT_OF_SCOPE_DEFERRED]`, `[USER_SKIPPED]`, and the three
`[OPPORTUNISTIC_*]` lines — are stated **once**, resident, in `rules/scope-discipline.md`
§ Resident Guard — a session emits them during a fix pass, possibly without having loaded this
file. Restating them here would be the split-brain this extraction exists to avoid.

## Closed-Set Options (human exit E1)

For an out-of-scope critical finding, present **exactly three options, and only these**
(Default-tier policy):

1. **Expand scope to include the fix** — the named file becomes in-scope; expansion into a
   security/data-integrity file escalates review to `thorough` (Register #3); the round re-runs
   review at the expanded scope.
2. **Extract the urgent defect into its own change** — it gets its own review cycle; the original
   task pauses and, after the extracted fix lands, re-enters its own review gate at the
   then-current digest.
3. **Abort the original task.**

**Skip is never offered proactively.** The model must not present "skip it and finish as normal"
as an option; a skip exists only when the user raises it themselves. When they do, record
`[USER_SKIPPED]` — this implements the existing "User asks to skip" Default exception
(§ Fix Obligation below), **bounded Anchor-first**: if the finding's content hits Anchor
Register #1 (a `rules/security.md` prohibition) or any other Register item, the Default exception
cannot override it — report the conflict through the proposal channel (@rules/discretion.md) and
do not record `[USER_SKIPPED]`.

A `[USER_SKIPPED]` is **valid** only when all of these hold: same finding identity (the
`skills/codex-code-review/references/review-common.md` identity contract: file + canonical issue
text — line numbers are not part of
identity, so line drift caused by other fixes does not break the match); the Anchor-first check
above passed at creation; same task; all fields present and well-formed. Any failure ⇒ fail-closed
invalid: the finding returns to the gate. A substantively different issue in the same file does
not inherit the old authorization.

**Creating a disposition does not close the standing verdict.** The earlier `⛔ Blocked` report
and its fail note remain the current gate record (the gate verdict is the reviewer's report —
@rules/auto-loop.md); the model must not re-read an old Blocked as Ready or note a pass directly.
It must re-run review (`--continue` or an explicit re-dispatch) carrying the disposition list, and
only a fresh reviewer verdict deriving to `Ready × NONE` may be noted as pass.

## Helper-Sweep Ban (precise)

What is banned is the **repo-wide consistency sweep with no evidence of impact**: a helper or
pattern created to fix an in-scope finding is applied to scope-hit files only; "while I'm at it,
convert every same-shaped call in the repo" is not fixing, it is a scope violation. What is
**not** banned: interface-compatibility updates — when this branch changes a helper's signature or
semantics, updating its **direct callers** falls under condition 2 (one hop, cited call site) and
is ordinarily in-scope.

## Circuit Breaker (stops expansion; never rewrites scope)

The reference set is the **immutable task baseline** above plus its derived top-level directory
set; the **counters are round-scoped** — they reset at each review round, but always compare
against the task baseline, and new edits during a round never write back into it (otherwise an
edited file enters `git diff HEAD` and "non-baseline file" stops being mechanically decidable,
and per-round refreezing would grant the breaker a fresh five-file budget every round). Files at
the repo root (no first directory segment — `CLAUDE.md`, `package.json`) map to the virtual
bucket `<root>`, which counts as one directory for the second-subsystem trigger.

Trigger (judged against the baseline): within a single review round, fix edits touch **more than
5 files outside the baseline set**, or touch a **second top-level directory** outside the
baseline's directory set.

On trigger the breaker **only stops further expansion** (no more edits to new non-baseline
files); it has **no reclassifying force** over findings already on the table:

| Remaining finding | Disposition |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Independently out-of-scope (complete negative evidence) | `[OUT_OF_SCOPE_DEFERRED]`, per the behavior table |
| in-scope (incl. `uncertain`) ∧ **owed**: (`fix_obligation=mandatory` ∧ ≥ blocking) ∨ `fix_obligation=admitted` at any severity | **Must not be deferred**: the gate stays `⛔ Blocked` — human exit E2; the trigger itself is the signal that the fix footprint no longer matches the task (often `ARCHITECTURE`, but E2 stands on its own enumeration and needs no prior classification) |
| in-scope ∧ ≥ blocking ∧ `fix_obligation=deferred` | `[OPPORTUNISTIC_DEFERRED]` with `reason=breaker`; **does not block** and does not reach E2 — a proven candidate the change never owed is not evidence that the fix footprint outgrew the task, which is the only thing E2 decides |
| in-scope ∧ sub-threshold ∧ not `admitted` | `[NIT_DEFERRED]`, unchanged — an admitted sub-threshold finding is owed, so it is covered by the owed row above, never by this one |

Thresholds (5 files / second subsystem) are the issue's proposed values — review them after the
first real trigger.

## Gate Derivation (normalization-first)

Reviewer findings carry `origin=<in-diff|pre-existing|uncertain>`,
`scope_reason=<diff-file|one-hop|branch-introduced|pre-existing-outside|uncertain>`,
`change_relation=<affected|independent|uncertain>`, `evidence`,
and the field `scope=<in-scope|out-of-scope>` — **derived, not free**: `out-of-scope` ⇔
`origin=pre-existing ∧ scope_reason=pre-existing-outside`. Fail-closed reading: a missing field, an unknown enum
value, a contradictory combination (`origin=in-diff ∧ scope=out-of-scope`, `origin=in-diff ∧
change_relation=independent`, `scope_reason=branch-introduced ∧ change_relation=independent`), a
`pre-existing-outside` whose evidence lacks the complete negative case, or an in-scope `independent`
whose evidence cites no primary hunk ⇒ `uncertain` ⇒ in-scope **and** `fix_obligation=mandatory`.
A reviewer that forgets the fields degrades to today's behavior, never to something looser.
`fix_obligation` is then derived per § Opportunistic Envelope — orchestration-side, after
normalization, never from a reviewer's declaration.

`⛔ Blocked` ⇔ there exists an "in-scope ∧ `fix_obligation=mandatory` ∧ ≥ tier blocking severity"
finding, **or** an "in-scope ∧ `fix_obligation=admitted`" finding at any severity, **or** an
"out-of-scope ∧ critical ∧ no valid `[USER_SKIPPED]`" finding. The report's Gate section carries
`gate_reason=<NONE|IN_SCOPE_BLOCKING|OUT_OF_SCOPE_CRITICAL|BOTH>`; `NONE` is the only combination
lawful with `✅ Ready`. **Routing always follows the value derived from normalized findings,
never the reviewer's declaration** — a declared `Ready × NONE` wrapping a real in-scope blocking
finding routes as `Blocked × IN_SCOPE_BLOCKING`, and a declared `Blocked` with no blocking
finding routes as `Ready × NONE`; findings too incomplete to derive ⇒ conservatively
`Blocked × BOTH`. Other out-of-scope findings never block `✅ Ready`; they are listed in the
report's "Out-of-Scope Findings" section. The full routing matrix lives in `codex-code-review`'s
§ Step 4.5. The dual-reviewer field-level
merge (conservative: any in-scope or `uncertain` source ⇒ in-scope; out-of-scope only when every
source independently proves it) and the prompt field contract live in
`skills/codex-code-review/references/review-common.md`.

## Human Exits (enumerated here — closed list)

- **E1 `OUT_OF_SCOPE_CRITICAL`** (including the leading decision of `BOTH`): an out-of-scope
  critical finding awaits the user's choice among the closed-set options.
- **E2 breaker-triggered with in-scope *owed* findings remaining** — `fix_obligation=mandatory` at
  or above the tier's blocking severity, or `admitted` at any severity (§ Circuit Breaker's owed
  row): the fix footprint no longer matches the task; the user decides re-scope or abort. A
  `deferred` candidate remaining is **not** an E2 trigger: the change never owed it, so it is no
  evidence the footprint outgrew the task.

These two, together with the exits `rules/auto-loop.md` enumerates, form the closed list of human
exits (root `CLAUDE.md` states the union).

## Anchor Compatibility (inherited Register hits — resolution step 0)

Scope classification decides **which findings demand a fix — it never exempts any actual edit
from re-review**: whenever an edit lands, the digest moves, the plane re-opens, and the reviewer
re-runs (Register #6). There is no user exception to this sentence. The Anchor hits this rule
inherits resolve at step 0 and **are not new Register items**. Scope expansion into
security/data-integrity files is reviewed at `thorough` (Register #3). Deferred/skip records
never carry secrets (Register #2). A finding whose content hits `rules/security.md` takes
Register #1 precedence over any skip (§ Closed-Set Options).

## Fix Obligation

Moved verbatim from the retired Fix All Issues rule, `fix-all-issues.md` (rules-residency task 3); `rules/auto-loop.md`
§ Fix Obligation keeps the resident core. It keeps its Default tier; the exception table's logging
duty stands as written. Cross-references inside it keep their wording: "this rule" is this section,
and `auto-loop.md` / `scope-discipline.md` are the resident rules.

**Every *owed* in-scope blocking issue gets fixed. "Unrelated", "pre-existing", "no impact", "later" are not reasons — a scope claim counts only as the proven, recorded exit @rules/scope-discipline.md defines, and "pre-existing" alone never removes the obligation: only a proven causal-independence classification followed by a recorded `[OPPORTUNISTIC_DEFERRED]` does.**

This rule bans *excuses*. It does not decide what counts as blocking — `auto-loop.md` § Tiers owns the severity axis and `scope-discipline.md` owns the scope axis. The fix obligation covers **owed in-scope** findings (including `uncertain`, which fail-closed reads as in-scope): `fix_obligation=mandatory` at or above the tier's blocking severity, **plus** every `fix_obligation=admitted` finding at any severity — admission is a commitment taken inside an open fix phase, so it outlives the severity line. An **out-of-scope critical** finding (P0 / security / data-integrity) is *not* fixed under this rule: it routes to human exit E1 — blocked, surfaced, never swept into a repo-wide fix pass and never silently dropped.

### What fixing means

Fix the root cause, not the symptom, and fix it when you find it rather than queueing it. A fix you cannot explain in these terms is not finished:

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | The specific symptom |
| **Why** | The root cause, not the surface one |
| **How** | The change you made |
| **Prevention** | Which **existing or just-added** control catches this class next time — usually the regression test this fix ships with. An explanation, never an obligation to add another guard artifact |

### Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
|-----------|-----------|
| User asks to skip | They said so explicitly |
| Beyond current scope | Needs architecture-level change — report and log it, do not silently drop it |
| Out-of-scope per scope-discipline | File-level out-of-scope pre-existing defect, proven by complete negative evidence (`@rules/scope-discipline.md`). Non-critical: logged `[OUT_OF_SCOPE_DEFERRED]` and deferred. Critical (P0 / security / data-integrity): human exit E1 — never silently dropped |
| Third-party library | Cannot modify; document the workaround |
| Below the tier's blocking severity | The gate already passed. Log `[NIT_DEFERRED]` and proceed — see `auto-loop.md` § Sub-Threshold Findings for the two that are still fixed on the spot. **Not available to a `fix_obligation=admitted` finding**: admission makes it owed at any severity, so the gate has not passed |
| Dismiss verified via `/seek-verdict` | Codex independently confirmed NON_ACTIONABLE by blind verification. P2/Nit automated (confidence ≥ 0.80/0.70, evidence ≥ 2/1); P0/P1 needs human confirmation (`DISMISS_CANDIDATE` + user confirm). Thresholds: `skills/seek-verdict/references/policy-mapping.md`. Logged via `[DISMISS_VERDICT]` |
| Skill is analysis-only | The skill declares read-only / analysis-only / plan mode; findings go in the report, not into edits. Logged via `[ANALYSIS_ONLY_DEFERRED]` |
| Opportunistic budget deferral | A proven pre-existing, causally independent, non-critical finding the envelope cannot take: it is closed or exhausted, the footprint does not fit, the breaker tripped, or no mandatory fix phase is open (`@rules/scope-discipline.md` § Resident Guard item 6). Logged via `[OPPORTUNISTIC_DEFERRED]` when at or above the tier's blocking severity; a sub-threshold non-admitted candidate keeps `[NIT_DEFERRED]` (one record per finding, never both). **Never applies** to `origin=in-diff`, branch-introduced, `uncertain`, `change_relation=affected`, P0, security or data-integrity findings — nor to one already `admitted`, which is owed at any severity |

Each of these leaves a record. None of them is "I decided it didn't matter."

### Precedence

Zero tolerance applies to what the tier calls **blocking** among **in-scope, owed** findings (incl. `uncertain` — @rules/scope-discipline.md) — those get fixed, and "not my code" is an excuse only until the scope rule's complete negative evidence proves it. "Owed" is `fix_obligation=mandatory` **at or above the tier's blocking severity**, or `fix_obligation=admitted` at **any** severity — the severity bound applies to `mandatory` alone, exactly as in the preamble above. An out-of-scope **critical** finding still blocks but is routed to E1, not fixed here. In-scope findings below the blocking line are deferred with a `[NIT_DEFERRED]` log — except an `admitted` one, which is owed at any severity; a proven opportunistic candidate the envelope could not take is deferred with `[OPPORTUNISTIC_DEFERRED]` **when at or above the blocking line** and with `[NIT_DEFERRED]` below it (one record per finding, never both); out-of-scope non-critical ones with `[OUT_OF_SCOPE_DEFERRED]` — recordings, not skips: `/codex-review-branch` picks them up when the change is next reviewed at depth.

This rule has never meant "every remark from a reviewer must be actioned before you may stop". Reading it that way is what turned a passing `✅ Ready` gate into another round of work.

When a blocking finding survives repeated fix → re-review cycles, take `auto-loop.md`'s `⚠️ Need Human` exit. Zero tolerance governs the fix *attempt*; the stop decision belongs to auto-loop.

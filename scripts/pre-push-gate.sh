# pre-push-gate.sh - Terminal confirmation gate for protected-branch pushes AND for ref updates
# that rewrite history — two independent classes, asking two different questions. The second
# covers unprotected branches and existing tags, so "protected branch gate" understates it.
# Installed as the git pre-push hook by /codex-setup. /install-scripts only copies
# this file into .claude/scripts/; it never wires up a hook. Manual install:
#   cp scripts/pre-push-gate.sh .git/hooks/pre-push && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push
#
# Bypass env vars (ALLOW_PUSH_PROTECTED, ALLOW_FORCE_WITH_LEASE, ALLOW_FORCE_UNSHARED), which
# push each authorizes, and why the last is developer-set only: rules/git-workflow.md
# § Push safety — the authority, not a copy of it.
#
# git hands the hook <remote-name> <remote-url> on argv, and one line per pushed ref on stdin:
#   <local-ref> <local-sha> <remote-ref> <remote-sha>

# lookup), because `[`, `builtin`, `command`, `exec`, `exit`, `set` and `test` can each be
# answered by a function imported from the environment.
# $BASH_ENV is sourced before line 1, so nothing in this file is early enough to disarm it —
# hence `-p` on the shebang, the only place it CAN be carried, and `-S` so it fits there at all.
# The credential is the ARGUMENT COUNT, never the env marker.
# Executed, never sourced — a refusal, not a defence, and it does not stop a forged `$0`.

# It sat here commented `unused` until 2026-08-22, which is what made the destination race look
# irreducible from inside the client — it is not; git hands the answer over.

# git passes the destination *location* as $1 when the push names no remote, so $1 is the URL
# itself — credentials included. Both prompts below print it, and a prompt is exactly where a token
# must not appear (`rules/security.md`, Anchor Register #2). Redact once; print only the redaction.
# Three credential-bearing components, each masked whole: userinfo — split at the LAST `@` inside
# the authority, because git parses it that way and the first `@` leaves the tail of a password
# behind — plus query and fragment. The second arm below covers the scp-like form, which also has a
# user field; a remote *name* matches neither arm and passes through untouched.
# What redaction costs: two destinations differing only inside a masked component read alike. For
# userinfo that merges two credentials for one repository, never two repositories. For query and
# fragment the loss is real where a host identifies the repository by parameter — accepted, since
# the alternative is printing the token. Scheme, host and path are never masked, so a redirect to a
# different repository stays visible. Same transformation as the `PUSH_URLS_SAFE` blocks in
# `skills/push-ci/SKILL.md` and `skills/epic-merge/SKILL.md`; keep the three in step.
# A function and not an inline block, because `$2` needs the identical treatment for the binding
# message below. Two copies of a redactor is how one of them ends up a version behind, and this one

# ── Destination binding ────────────────────────────────────────────
# The race this closes: an approval names a destination, and between the naming and the push a
# `.git/config` edit or a `url.<x>.pushInsteadOf` rewrite sends the objects elsewhere. The two
# authorized skills re-read the destination immediately before pushing and compare, which narrows
# the window to that fence — it cannot close it, because their re-read is a different process from
# the push. The claim that this is therefore irreducible client-side was wrong, and this block is
# the correction: git resolves the destination INSIDE the pushing process and hands it here as `$2`.
#
#
# The variable carries a SET — one SHA-256 per approved destination, whitespace separated — and
# membership is the test. Three properties hold, none optional: monotone (unset ⇒ nothing happens),
# fail-closed (set but unverifiable ⇒ refuse), and not an attestation (it never substitutes for a
# `/dev/tty` prompt).
#
# **What this block assumes, stated because the block below defends the function channel and not
# this one**: that PATH resolves to genuine `git` and a genuine digest tool. Every check in this
# file runs a PATH-resolved binary — `git merge-base` decides the force class too — so a PATH shim
# defeats the whole gate, not this binding in particular, and `bash -p` closes the imported-function
# channel only. The known-answer test below therefore raises the floor rather than closing a hole.
#
# The measurements behind each of those — `$1` vs `$2` under a rewrite, one hook call per push URL,
# why SHA-256 rather than `git hash-object`, what the receivepack check below does and does not
# catch, and why two of the three authorized skills now spell `--receive-pack=git-receive-pack`
# (`/gh-stack` cannot — the extension issues the push, so neither that flag nor
# `SD0X_PUSH_DEST_DIGEST` is available to it): see
# docs/features/push-gate-optin/4-implementation.md § 4.6.

# ── Shared-branch attestation for force-form pushes ───────────────
# `rules/git-workflow.md` prohibits force-pushing a *shared* branch, but the protected
# set (main/master/develop/release/*, plus the project's additions) is only the part of "shared" a name can decide.
# A two-person `feat/*` head is shared and no name says so — and git cannot tell us:
# nothing in a ref line, an ancestry test or a lease check reports who else has the
# branch. So the class is defined by **attestation, not inference**: the operator says
# it, at the terminal, about the branch named back to them. That is the same primitive
# the protected gate uses and the reason it exists — /dev/tty is immune to the session
# permission caching that can auto-approve an in-session prompt.
#
# Placed after the non-fast-forward refusal and before the protected bypass. It asks
# only about the refs this push actually rewrites (FORCE_REFS), and only about the ones
# the protected gate below will not already ask about — so no single REF is asked about
# twice. That is the claim; "one push, one prompt" was the earlier wording and it was
# false: a push carrying a protected fast-forward AND an unprotected rewrite fires this
# prompt for the rewritten ref and then the protected one for the other, measured under a
# pty. None of the three authorized skills can produce such a push — the two that push git
# directly push one refspec each, and `/gh-stack` pushes only stack layers, none of which may be
# a protected branch (`skills/gh-stack/SKILL.md` § Phase 2) — but a
# manual push can, and a comment that overstates the property is how fd 3 and fd 4 came to
# be justified by a scoping argument that did not hold.
#
# That exclusion is conditional, and the condition is the whole of its justification:
# it holds because the protected gate reaches /dev/tty, and ALLOW_PUSH_PROTECTED=1
# makes that gate `exit 0` without asking anything. Under it, a protected force target
# has no other prompt to fall through to, so it belongs here. Writing the exclusion
# unconditionally left exactly that hole — ALLOW_PUSH_PROTECTED=1 together with
# ALLOW_FORCE_WITH_LEASE=1 force-pushed `main` past both gates in silence. The two
# variables answer different questions and neither may answer the other's.

# evidence about the push, never about who else holds the branch — which is precisely the

# different questions". Excluding a protected rewrite from the attestation prompt on the grounds
# that this one will ask about it is only sound if this one actually ASKS the other question.
